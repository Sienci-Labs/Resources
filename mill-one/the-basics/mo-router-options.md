If you've already got a router for your Mill One, skip this step.

Rotary tools come in all shapes and sizes. When considering a tool for your Mill One it's important to consider its speed range, runout, and its ability to maintain the desired speed. The Sienci Mill One utilizes a third-party rotary tool which enables it to cut through many types of materials for a wide variety of applications.

Based on the routers we've tested, we highly recommend the Makita RT0701 or Ridgid R24012 router. These two routers offer great performance at reasonable prices. You can typically find these routers at your local hardware store or online with free shipping. Purchasing links can be found below.

### Makita RT0700/RT0701

The Makita RT0700/RT0701 router is a commonly used palm router boasting a 1-1/4HP motor. It offers a wide speed range (10,000RPM to 30,000RPM), which is electronically controlled for reliably consistent speed. With a metal body, it is extremely durable. Our test units have been used for hundreds of hours without fail, on projects that take over 6 hours. This is our go-to recommended router as it is widely available in both 120V and 220V.

### Ridgid R24012

The Ridgid R24012 is also an outstanding router, with a 1-1/2HP motor. It's electronic speed control allows for spindle speeds of between 20,000RPM to 30,000RPM. The R24012 also comes with a handy LED light at the base, which helps illuminate the bit, plus registered buyers receive a lifetime warranty on their tool. This router is extremely capable on the Mill One, and great deals can be found when on sale at Home Depot. However, this router is more difficult to find through other online channels and no 220V currently is available.

### Other tools

While the tools above have been tested by us on the Sienci Mill One, some of these tools have been used by our customers.  If you are purchasing a Mill One and intend to use a tool which is not the Makita RT0701 or Ridgid R24012, please contact us to inquire about a custom mount for your tool. Please note that we recommend that tools be under 75mm in diameter and under 5lbs. Some of the following rotary tools are additional viable options:

<ul>
  <li>Dewalt DWP611</li>
  <li>Bosch Colt</li>
</ul>

Tools from Dremel, Proxxon, and other handheld rotary tool makers do work, however, they are typically underpowered for anything than the lightest jobs. We recommend only using tools under 300 watts if you plan on sticking to milling foam or doing light engraving work.
