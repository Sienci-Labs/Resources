The Sienci Mill One requires a connection to a computer to receive cutting commands. These commands come in the form of a g-code file, generated by CAM software. The purpose of g-code sending software is to load the g-code file and stream each line of the code to the machine.

### <a href="http://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UGS / UGS Platform</a>

For g-code sending, we use <b>Universal G-code Sender</b> - plainly named since it's able to stream g-code to nearly any type of device. UGS is simple and uses Java, which means you can run it on Windows, Mac, Linux, and other operating systems as long as you have the latest Java version installed.

Once you've got your Mill One assembled, on the <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/mo-preparing-to-cut/">Preparing to Cut</a> page you'll learn how to use UGS to make your future projects.
Download UGS here: <a href="https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/">https://winder.github.io/ugs_website/download/</a>

A different version of the UGS interface also exists which has more features and a bit of a larger learning curve but is worth it if you're willing to give it a shot.

There are a few other choices in g-code sending software that we can recommend once you're comfortable with UGS.

### <a href="https://github.com/GridSpace/grid-print" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid-Print</a> via Kiri:Moto (Optional)

Kiri:Moto allows you to operate your CNC machine inside the browser using a <a href="https://github.com/johnlauer/serial-port-json-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serial post JSON server</a> and requires some setup to allow your web browser to send g-code to your Sienci Mill One. You can also set up the JSON server for <a href="http://chilipeppr.com/grbl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChilliPeppr</a>, another browser based G-code sender with some additional features.
