The grbl firmware has a whole list of Alarms and Error codes that you can encounter when running your CNC. gSender will always display a question mark when there’s an alarm which you can hover over for more information about why it happened and errors will appear as a hovering box in the bottom corner of the visualizer.

You can close an alarm by clicking on the button that appears next to it in the visualizer. Most alarms can also be handled by typing “$x” into the ‘Console’ tab and hitting the ‘Run’ button.

### Error 1, 2, 20, 24, 26, 28

When any of these errors appear in gSender, it can typically be traced back to these sources:

1. **You are connected with the wrong firmware**
   - Check this in the top, left corner of the app when you're connected, is should say:
      - "grbl" for the majority of CNCs including older LongMills, Shapeoko, Genmitsu, Mill One, X-Carve, etc.
      - "grblHAL" for AltMill (SLB Ext), LongMill (SLB), or any other grblHAL board
   - If the firmware is incorrect go to Config ➜ Firmware Fallback ➜ select the correct firmware ➜ Apply Settings.
1. **The g-code file itself has errors in it**
   - Check that you are using the right <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/am-post-processors/>">post processor in your CAM software</a> then try re-generating the file (see more with [Error 33](#error-33) below).
   - Go to Config ➜ Basics ➜ Notifications and turn on 'Warn if bad file' to see if you get notified that the file is still bad when you reload it.
1. **You have an unstable connection to your CNC**
   - Check if your USB cable is loose or if other ports or connectors on your CNC board are loose.
   - Try another USB port on your computer, another computer all together, and if you're using a USB hub try connecting directly to your CNC instead.
   - Don't use a USB Stick, make sure the files are on the hard-drive of your computer.
   - Determine if it's from electromagnetic interference/static. Run the job in the air with your router/spindle and dust collector turned off to see if the same errors appear. If they go away then try running the job normally again using scrap material, just to confirm the errors reappear. If this happens, you'll want to look into putting your computer and controller on a separate circuit from the router/spindle and dust collector, or <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-issues-and-fixes/#using-a-dust-collector-system-causes-the-machine-to-disconnect">grounding your equipment</a>.
1. **Some gSender versions can have bugs**
   - This is the least likely cause, but a couple gSender versions have been known to make errors appear that don't affect operation. Try <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/gs-installation/#older-versions">using a different gSender version</a>. 

### Error 33

Can pop up as "Motion command target is invalid" and usually comes from issues with G2 or G3 arc/curve movements in the g-code. If the target is invalid you might want to verify the file again in gSender or regenerate it in CAM with the right post processor.

For example, there have been [many](https://forum.sienci.com/t/invalid-g-code-id-33-in-gsender/10904) [reports](https://community.carbide3d.com/t/grbl-error-invalid-gcode-id-33/1204) that if you use the `inch` post processor in Vectric, Carveco, or Fusion 360 then they won't add enough decimal places to satisfy arc curve calculations - which will cause an Error 33. The best solution is to just use a `mm` post processor to get more accurate movements, or for Carveco use `UGS grbl`.

If this isn't the cause, then refer to the steps shown for [Errors 1, 2, 20, 24, 26, 28](#error-1-2-20-24-26-28) shown above.
