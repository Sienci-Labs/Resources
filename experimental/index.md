## Elaborate / more Comprehensive content on

- **Claimed by Kelly** "CNC Routers" general explanation on CNCs and what they can do
- **Claimed by Kelly** "Surfacing" better explain what it's accomplishing, bit selection, and the different ways to set it up
- **Claimed by Kelly** "Routers/Spindles" explore what situations you should choose which
- **Claimed by Chris** "Vortex basics" explanation, fine by Daniel as long as it's not too technical
- **Claimed by Stephen** "Dust Collection" more reference material for setup, suggestions
- **Claimed by Stephen** "Workholding" all the revised methods available, sorted to help choose which one is best for your project plans
- "Cutting Tools" different types, how they're used, how to pick them
- "Materials" change to talk about materials typically cut, why you'd choose them, where to source them
- "Projects" walk through more of the steps to get to the point of creating a project
- "Software Explained" add in typical files you need/work with and some more pictures like used in Vortex
- "Tables/Enclosures" more guidance on pre-built tables, how to choose which design, address AC wiring setup
- "Tool Changing" need to take a fully true stab at explaining all the tool changing methods
- "Tools & Router" more handbook material on quick-reference on tool and spindle/router handling
- "Touch Plate" clearer, simpler explanation on setting up our add-ons
- "Touch Plates" why are they used on CNCs, what are the other options

## New Pages

- **Claimed by Stephen** Tramming
- **Claimed by Stephen** Preparing to be a CNC Owner
- CNC Buyers Guide
- How to start a business/price CNC Projects  
- Video Compilation Page
- How to handle an End-of-Life machine

## Bits 'n Bobs

- Make a comparison table between the LongMill and AltMill, and between the SLB and SLB EXT https://www.facebook.com/share/p/d5zSZWVBKmvNspPi/
- Refresh "Software Table" https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/Resources/issues/23
- Issues and Fixes
  - Add pics for MK2.5
  - After noticing that the y-axes were binding up right near the end of the movement of the axis I went through the process of loosening and re-tightening the anti-backlash blocks which solved the problem (really make a video on this sometime)
  - My spoil board has slight stripes as opposed to being perfectly flat… is this normal or do I have a tilt on my router that needs to be fixed? If so, how’s that done? (link to new tramming page)
  - Add more limit switch stuff (how gSender handles G28 retracts with homing on or off, potential issues with the MK2 Y-axis limit switch mounting)
  - Position a pointed bit (like a v-bit) near the work surface when you jiggle the axes to help look for looseness that needs tightening up
  - How to go about machine calibration
    - Squaring https://www.reddit.com/r/hobbycnc/s/W1Lnou54wt
    - https://forum.sienci.com/t/longmill-calibration/14254/15
- Handbook
  - Review how the utility of the 'Handbook' section for the MK2 is looking. It should include aspects that:
    - Cover any of the common information that a user might need for day-to-day operation of their machine once it's been set up
    - Talk with users or try to imagine yourself what sort of content you tend to need to reference while cutting, things like job setup, maintenance, common fixes
    - Shouldn't include any basic concepts (though pages on basic concepts can be linked to) since 'The Basics' and 'Software' make up their own sections
    - Cross-reference how troubleshooting is handled with the whole section allocated in AltMill https://resources.sienci.com/view/am-common-key-solutions/
    - Great video for maintenance https://youtube.com/shorts/pKBQFLKl1hY
  - Actionable items:
    - Your MK2, write a section on how to identify your LongMill model https://www.facebook.com/share/p/PC7vMCizMHi94jfb/
    - Restructure maintenance page to go over updating parts but also the steps to replace parts once fully worn out
    - Running jobs page could use more elaboration in places, and pictures
    - Mention how to handle safe heights regularly vs with the Vortex
    - How to zero in different scenarios or find zero on a piece of round stock or in stock center
      - Great video idea but there’s a much easier way to do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6TMRDtXMGA
- Sanding & Finishing
  - Do affiliate links for products? Most of the pics are grabbed from online stores (Amazon, etc)
  - Add section on Epoxy finishing - https://forum.sienci.com/t/how-should-i-finish-this/13995/20 or should this go into a new/separate page about
  epoxy design, pouring, sanding, polishing type of thing?
- Prepping to be a CNC owner
  - Set the expectations of someone starting on the CNC journey to set a reasonable bar of cost, learning curve, failure, machine maintenance, etc.
  - What accessories to buy and where to buy them
  - The bits required to make different projects and where to source them
  - Ensure this is positive and doesn't scare people off
  - Costs of getting CNCing https://youtu.be/Bh9xpCMKlFY

  - https://youtu.be/V8P1Y3n0O7Q
  - Kieswetter demolition for cheap materials
- Good initial explanation of open source https://youtu.be/F7iLfuci75Y?si=CLqkkr1pYQIpH6BC
