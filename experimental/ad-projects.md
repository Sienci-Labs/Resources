Outline the typical steps you'd follow to make a CNC project (link these general steps out to elaborated guided pages)

- Come up with an idea of what you want to make or seek out inspiration
- Consider the materials you have on hand or what you'd like to use (measure the size)
- Start designing based on ideas you find or use pre-made projects
- Create the toolpaths based on the cutting tools for the job or the ones you have available
- Clamp based on the setup needed
- Running cutting and swap out cutting tools or change out material as needed
- Do rough material cleanup and dry-fit pieces to make sure they turned out well
- Apply any finishing to the material and do final assembly

Garrett Fromme sent along an email to all his followers of sites to use for CNCing and I kinda wanted to vet them to see if there were any others worth adding to our own resources in ‚ÄúExplore Projects‚Äù

There's plenty more that CNC routers like the LongMill are capable of doing once you're comfortable with the process of going from an idea on a piece of paper to a final product.

## CNC Creator Guides

If you are looking for cool projects to create, then you are at the right place. We are creating individual e-books for awesome projects that we make YouTube video tutorials on called CNC Creator Guides. These guides are perfect for beginners interested in learning how to create projects on their CNC. They consist of downloadable project files and contain detailed step-by-step instructions with images, making it easier for the maker to understand and follow along. By following these guides, you can successfully build these projects and show off all your hard work.

## Online CNC File Sites

If you're looking for some more inspiration, or would like to start by making some pre-made projects, there are plenty of places online which offer pre-made artwork, drawings, and 3D models that are either free or can be purchased. In order to start you off, we put a list of some of these places together. Please note that we've done our best to filter out reliable file sources, but downloading any files online can pose a risk so be sure to only get files from sources that you trust.

## More Sample Projects

There are a few more internally designed projects that you can also try out if you wish. Each project has a download which contains both the g-code files made for each specific project (pictured) and the original 3D files if you want to CAM them yourself. There are even more designs that we've made for use on the MK2 that can be found here if you're interested in giving them a shot: <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/526b7c6287b77b77c4b50603/w/e1e191a2557529d4dc468313/e/92d2cf99720fafafddaba831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LongMill Demo Pieces</a>
