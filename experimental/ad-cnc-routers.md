The many hobby CNCs are known as "3-axis CNC routers". What does that mean? Let's break the phrase down into its components:

- **CNC** → stands for “computer numerical control”; a type of machine that can be controlled by a computer using movement instructions
- **Router** → a woodworking tool that acts like a drill; it spins a cutting tool to cut through material
- **3-axis** → the ability to move in three, independent directions

Putting it all together, you get a machine with the ability to cut complex **3D objects** with a **spinning cutter** controlled by a **computer**.


The router’s motion is defined by three directions, which are straight lines called the X, Y and Z axes.

On the LongMill, the X and Y-axis movement systems are based on wheels and lead screws. The v-shaped wheels ride on the edge of the extruded aluminum profiles. This alignment allows for accurate motion while the lead screws transfer mechanical power from the stepper motors.

On the Z-axis, the movement system utilizes linear guides and a lead screw, where the alignment occurs between the linear rails and blocks containing ball bearings. Similar to the other axes, the motor power is transmitted by the lead screw. Since the Z-axis requires finer and more precise motion, the linear guides minimize friction while maintaining alignment in this direction.

Industrial CNC milling machines take all these concepts a step further. This can involve introducing more axes (such as rotation), more powerful and repeatable drive systems, and much larger cutting volumes as well.

Whether you are using an industrial CNC mill or a hobby CNC router, they all require some way to communicate between the computer and the machine. The “language” they use is called “g-code,” which tells the CNC how to move and interact with different inputs. G-code is sent from the computer to the machine’s controller through “machine interface” software programs. Some higher end CNC machines will have a computer built into the machine to standardize the operating system and eliminate the potential for hardware incompatibilities, but most hobby machines will require the user to source the computer.

The controller is an important component of a CNC, since it is the “brains” of the whole system. It relays information from the g-code to motors, sensors, switches and other electronics to ensure the machine operates correctly and effectively. Furthermore, it stores key settings that are accessed every time the computer connects to the machine. Over the years we have designed custom controllers for the LongMill, its details are described <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/slb-welcome/#past-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.

CNC routers are quite capable when it comes to manufacturing a variety of objects. Most hobby-level machines can cut into wood, plastic, foam, machining wax, and similar soft materials. More powerful machines can also handle soft metals like aluminum, brass, and copper, to harder materials like stone, tiling, and high-carbon steels. These high performance CNC routers start to overlap with more industrial CNC milling machines.

The CNC operation of running a g-code file is called a “job.” Jobs can vary from simple surface engravings, profiles, pocketing, relief carvings, to using multi-orientated jigs for cutting from many sides. Most of the time, projects can be made with simple 2D cuts. To do 2D cutting, you can start with a drawing or picture, then define how each line or shape should be cut; this is called a “toolpath.” It is very common to combine multiple jobs with different toolpaths to create something highly unique and memorable.

The world of 3D carving allows you to create even more intricate objects, if you choose to explore this path. Depending on how complicated your project is, it may require a more advanced understanding of software and CNC workflows to successfully execute it. For example, if you are looking to create your own design, rather than find a 3D file online, you may need to learn how to use CAD (computer-aided design) software. Or if you wish to create a two-sided project, you will need to precisely flip and re-align the material after the first side is completed. Nevertheless, 3D carving leads to impressive results, so it is definitely worth trying out! A simple relief can be a great starting point for 3D carving.

So now that we discussed the technical capabilities of the CNC router, what sort of items can it produce? From charcuterie boards and cabinetry, to engraved glasses, light up acrylic signs and aluminum motorcycle parts, there’s a whole lot that can be made. Below are some examples of pieces made on the LongMill by our wonderful customers.
