Can go in “Handbook” section

- If machine still works but not large enough, upgrade size
- If machine starting to break down, pick up new parts to get it working again
- If no longer interested, resell, where to resell (Forum, FB group, FB Marketplace and other online marketplaces) or convert into another style of machine like dedicated laser engraver
