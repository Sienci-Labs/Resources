Touch Plates
Better explain their utility on the machine and why someone might be interested to use one over alternative zeroing methods. 

Explain the difference between the different touch plates designs (primarily: Z-only vs. block vs. AutoZero)

How each is used could be explained better

Should ideally be rewritten to show wiring as its own section

Show setting up either touch plate in software
