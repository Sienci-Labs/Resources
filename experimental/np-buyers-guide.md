Can go in “The Basics” section
Try to make as neutral a writeup as possible on how to choose what CNC is best for you

- Link to Garrett, Two Moose, and other videos on this topic
- Address the tenants of what makes a good CNC and good company to buy from
- What style machine best suits people's needs
- Lay out pros and cons of all the linear motion systems
  - Mechanical engineering perspective of different motion systems and how they pertain to maintenance, cost, accuracy, etc. This would be stuff like V-wheels, linear rails, belts, lead screws, ball screws
  - https://www.avidcnc.com/support/faq/#which-is-better-a-screw-or-rack-and-pinion-drive
  - https://www.camaster.com/frequently-asked-questions/
  - Belts vs linear rails https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVs3KqnWgFk
  - Argument of running wheels vs. rails, Grant thinks that it might actually come down to people wanting to blame the CNC suddenly going wrong to attribute it to the v-wheels since they need constant adjustment so they think if they switched to rails then that wouldn't happen anymore
  - FAQ in forum about why adjustable wheels are on top
  - Use pictures from the most recent Onefinity post showing problems
  - "onefinity rails jammed up" "onefinity wiper"

  - AM vs OF https://www.facebook.com/groups/mill.one/posts/2043482112789776/
  - Gif for discussing machine design https://www.reddit.com/r/hobbycnc/s/bVTKL45Ykq
- The accuracy of different homing sensors, referencing many other write-ups and videos on the topics including the accuracy of the sensorless homing
- Great video, part near the end that talks about tool price and what a higher price gets you https://youtu.be/pktydCxlqz4
- Mention 3-in-1 machines and why they just don't make sense nowadays with cheap 3D printers and cheap laser cutters
  - Link some forum posts and whatnot, like: https://reddit.com/r/hobbycnc/s/g3yojwhAXE
  - Why 3-in-1s not good https://www.reddit.com/r/hobbycnc/s/w0Nueub7Nc
- Typical types of maintenance needed
- Buying options
