Can go in “The Basics” section and be a sort of page that can set the expectations of someone starting on the CNC journey to set a reasonable bar of cost, learning curve, failure, machine maintenance, etc.



Here are some basics. This kind of work is cut with a CNC router, usually using various diameters of round nosed bits. Fine detail and smooth surfaces are challenging. All round nose bits produce a scalloped surface. Putting the scallops close together reduces the effect, but it can't ever be eliminated. Closely spaced cuts take time, lots of time, especially on inexpensive machines that move slowly. It's a tradeoff between hours cutting vs hours sanding. Fine detail requires small bits. Removing lots of material requires large bits. The work is usually done with one or more roughing passes followed by one or more finish passes.

Creating toolpath is done with CAM software. The good stuff is expensive, shockingly expensive. The cheap or free stuff is limited. Creating the 3D model is hard, and requires specialized 3D modelling skill. Even with good software, it's really hard. Not only do you need artistic skill, but the programs are hard to learn. Like CAM, the best 3D modelling software is shockingly expensive and the free or cheap stuff is limited

Machines range from cheap and small to large and expensive. Rigidity and repeatability are critical. If you are going to be running a small cutter over the pattern for 10 hours, you need to make sure the machine is able to hold tolerance for that time

It's a lot to learn, but can be very rewarding. Unless you have a lot of money, start with a small, cheap machine and cheap/free software. Make simple designs until you get familiar, then add complexity as your skills grow
