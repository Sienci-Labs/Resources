Can go in “The Basics” section
Set the expectations of someone starting on the CNC journey to set a reasonable bar of cost, learning curve, failure, machine maintenance, etc.
**Stephen is working on this**

- What accessories to buy and where to buy them
- The bits required to make different projects and where to source them

Ensure this is positive and doesn't scare people off

## Setting Expectations

You've done the hours of research and are ready to embark on your CNC journey. Ready to push the boat from the shore and jump in with both oars straining under your power. You will make magnificent creations that the world will line up to gander at. In time your marvels will be in a museum! Wait, is that rain I feel on my cheek? (Downpour of information incoming) Why am I veering off to the left all the time in this boat? (Machine maintenance) Did I remember to pack a bailer to get this water out?(How am I gonna do this? Community can help)

We get it. It's a really exciting time and you are eager to start! Let's review what you are getting yourself into, the learning journey you will be taking and what icebergs to look out for along the way.

### Costs

Machine, router or spindle, accessories, end mills<br>
Dust collection strategy<br>
Safety equipment<br>
Computer, monitor, mouse<br>
Software<br>
Supplies - workholding, sandpaper, finishing oils & stains, saws, sanders, etc<br>
Table - worktable + wasteboard + enclosure (video playlist here?!!?)<br>

### Machine Maintenance

Starting your journey with a CNC setup is exciting, but it’s important to set realistic expectations to ensure a smoother experience. Here are some key aspects to consider:

### 1. **Initial Costs**

- **Machine Cost:** CNC machines come in a range of prices depending on size, precision, and brand. Entry-level machines can start around $500–$2,000, while more advanced or larger machines can go well beyond $5,000.
- **Additional Costs:** You’ll also need software for designing your projects, which could involve one-time purchases or subscription fees. Accessories like end mills, clamps, dust collection systems, and materials (wood, MDF, etc.) will add to your initial investment.
- **Upgrades:** Over time, you may want to upgrade parts, like getting better tooling or adding additional features (such as an upgraded spindle or a laser engraver).

### 2. **Space Requirements**

Setting up your CNC woodworking area requires careful planning, as you'll need more space than just for the machine itself. Here are some critical aspects to consider:

- **Table + Dust Collection:**  
  Your CNC machine will need a sturdy, flat table or workbench **(link to ad-tables-enclosures.md update)** to rest on. Additionally, CNC projects generate a lot of dust, so a proper dust collection system **(Link to ad-dust-collection.md update)** is essential. This could be a small vacuum setup or a dedicated dust collector to keep your workspace clean and prevent damage to your machine and electronics.

- **Wood Storage:**  
  You’ll need a space to store wood materials, whether it’s sheets of plywood, hardwoods, or other materials. It’s a good idea to designate a dry, organized area to prevent wood warping or damage and to ensure easy access during projects.

- **Tools and Bits:**  
  Over time, you’ll accumulate a variety of bits, clamps, and accessories. Make sure you have proper storage for these tools near your CNC machine to ensure quick access and to avoid misplacing or damaging small, delicate items like end mills and bits.

The **Sienci Labs SuperLongBoard (SLB)** and the spindle you'll be using with your CNC setup have specific power requirements you should be aware of, particularly when it comes to **amp draw**.

1. **Spindle Power Draw**:
   - The **spindle** size and power rating will greatly influence the amp draw. Common spindles range from **0.8KW** to **2.2KW**, with their power needs being higher based on their wattage. For example:
     - A **1.5KW spindle** running on **120V** will typically draw around **12.5 amps**.
     - A **2.2KW spindle** on **120V** can draw up to **18 amps**.
   - If your electrical system is based on **110V/120V** with standard **15A breakers**, a **1.5KW spindle** is usually the highest you can safely run without tripping breakers. For larger spindles (like 2.2KW), you'll either need a dedicated circuit with higher amperage or operate on **220V**

2. **SuperLongBoard (SLB) Power**:
   - The **SuperLongBoard** itself will require an external power supply, often around **24V with a 10A capacity**. Ensure that your total system, including the spindle, dust collection, and the CNC controller, does not overload your electrical circuits

In summary, a **1.5KW spindle** combined with the SLB will draw close to **12.5A**, which should work on a standard 120V, 15A circuit, but adding dust collection or other devices may require a dedicated circuit. If you opt for a **2.2KW spindle**, consider upgrading to a **220V circuit** to avoid tripping your breakers.

Make sure to plan your workshop's electrical setup to accommodate these requirements, and always check your circuit's breaker ratings to prevent overloading.

### 3. **Learning Curve**

- **Software Skills:** A significant part of CNC woodworking involves learning CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software. Programs like Fusion 360, Easel, or VCarve have varying degrees of complexity, and mastering them takes time.
- **Toolpaths and Settings:** Beyond software, understanding toolpaths (how the machine moves), feed rates, spindle speeds, and materials is crucial. These settings directly affect the success of your projects.
- **Patience Required:** Expect to spend a good amount of time experimenting and learning through trial and error. Your first few projects may not be perfect, and that’s completely normal.

### 4. **Failure is Part of the Process**

- **Trial and Error:** Don’t be discouraged if your first attempts don’t go as planned. It’s common to break bits, misalign materials, or get unexpected results. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
- **Material Wastage:** You will likely waste some material during the learning phase, whether from incorrect settings or accidents. Plan for some losses as you refine your skills.

### 5. **Machine Maintenance**

- **Regular Upkeep:** CNC machines require regular maintenance to perform optimally. This includes cleaning the machine, lubricating parts, checking for loose bolts, and inspecting wiring and belts.
- **Replacing Parts:** Over time, you’ll need to replace parts like end mills, which dull with use, or belts and bearings that wear out. Knowing how to maintain your machine will help avoid costly breakdowns.
- **Calibration:** Keeping your machine properly calibrated is key for accuracy. Routine checks on squareness, zeroing, and other factors will save you time and material in the long run.

### 6. **Time Commitment**

- **Setup and Testing:** Expect a significant amount of time to be spent on project setup—securing the workpiece, setting up toolpaths, and making sure everything is aligned. Testing new designs or tool setups on scrap materials is often necessary.
- **Project Completion:** Projects can take longer than expected, especially if you are refining a design, troubleshooting issues, or making multiple passes on a complicated cut. Patience is key.

### 7. **Software and Hardware Updates**

- **Software Updates:** CAD/CAM software is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to stay updated on new features or changes. This might require learning new tools or workflows.
- **Firmware and Hardware Upgrades:** Occasionally, you may need to update the firmware of your CNC machine or upgrade components as new technologies are released, improving precision and functionality.

### 8. **Community Support**

- **Learning from Others:** The CNC woodworking community is large and active. Online forums, YouTube tutorials, and CNC groups are invaluable resources for troubleshooting, tips, and inspiration. You’re not alone in the learning process.
- **Asking for Help:** Don’t hesitate to ask questions when you get stuck. Most CNC enthusiasts are willing to share their knowledge and help you through challenges.

### Final Thought: **Start Small**

- It’s tempting to jump straight into large or complex projects, but starting with simpler tasks will help you build confidence and understand your machine. Set realistic expectations for your first few months, focus on mastering the basics, and steadily work your way up to more advanced projects.

Embarking on your CNC journey can be incredibly rewarding, but it requires patience, learning, and ongoing investment. Stay curious, and embrace the mistakes as learning opportunities.
