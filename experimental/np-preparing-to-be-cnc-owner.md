Can go in “The Basics” section
Set the expectations of someone starting on the CNC journey to set a reasonable bar of cost, learning curve, failure, machine maintenance, etc.

Here are some basics. This kind of work is cut with a CNC router, usually using various diameters of round nosed bits. Fine detail and smooth surfaces are challenging. All round nose bits produce a scalloped surface. Putting the scallops close together reduces the effect, but it can't ever be eliminated. Closely spaced cuts take time, lots of time, especially on inexpensive machines that move slowly. It's a tradeoff between hours cutting vs hours sanding. Fine detail requires small bits. Removing lots of material requires large bits. The work is usually done with one or more roughing passes followed by one or more finish passes.

Creating toolpath is done with CAM software. The good stuff is expensive, shockingly expensive. The cheap or free stuff is limited. Creating the 3D model is hard, and requires specialized 3D modelling skill. Even with good software, it's really hard. Not only do you need artistic skill, but the programs are hard to learn. Like CAM, the best 3D modelling software is shockingly expensive and the free or cheap stuff is limited

Machines range from cheap and small to large and expensive. Rigidity and repeatability are critical. If you are going to be running a small cutter over the pattern for 10 hours, you need to make sure the machine is able to hold tolerance for that time

It's a lot to learn, but can be very rewarding. Unless you have a lot of money, start with a small, cheap machine and cheap/free software. Make simple designs until you get familiar, then add complexity as your skills grow

### Setting Expectations

You've done the hours of research and are ready to embark on your CNC journey. Ready to push the boat from the shore and jump in with both oars straining under your power. You will make magnificent creations that the world will line up to gander at. In time your marvels will be in a museum! Wait, is that rain I feel on my cheek? (Downpour of information incoming) Why am I veering off to the left all the time in this boat? (Machine maintenance) Did I remember to pack a bailer to get this water out?(How am I gonna do this? Community can help)

We get it. It's a really exciting time and you are eager to start! Let's review what you are getting yourself into, the learning journey you will be taking and what icebergs to look out for along the way.

### Costs

Machine, router or spindle, accessories, end mills<br>
Dust collection strategy<br>
Safety equipment<br>
Computer, monitor, mouse<br>
Software<br>
Supplies - workholding, sandpaper, finishing oils & stains, saws, sanders, etc<br>
Table - worktable + wasteboard + enclosure (video playlist here?!!?)<br>

### Space

Table + Dust collection<br>
Wood storage<br>
Tools and bits<br>
Saws, Sanders & Planers<br>

Electronics<br>
Computer & Monitor & Mouse
Dust collection
Controller & Spindle
One thing that I’m sure you know to consider is the amp draw of your spindle + the SLB and the rating of the breaker that runs the circuit.

### Learning Curve

### Failure

### Machine Maintenance
