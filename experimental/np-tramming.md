Can go in “Advanced” section
Cover all aspects of tramming but try to keep it general to apply to any CNC

- Nod and Tilt
- https://www.servomagazine.com/magazine/article/how-to-tram-your-cnc-router
- Order of steps to get everything nice with minimal effort
- Find if any other community videos have been made for our machines in particular
- My spoil board has slight stripes as opposed to being perfectly flat… is this normal or do I have a tilt on my router that needs to be fixed? If so, how’s that done?
