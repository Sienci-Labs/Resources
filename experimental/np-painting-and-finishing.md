## 1. Sanding

### TL;DR

Sanding is essential for smoothing rough surfaces left by the CNC process, removing imperfections, and preparing wood for finishing. Use different **hand tools** (sandpaper, sanding block, sanding sponge) or **power tools** (orbital sander, detail sander, belt sander) depending on the task. Choose the correct grit to begin and follow the grit progression (rough, medium, fine) for the best results.

**Breaking the edge** (rounding off sharp corners) enhances safety, finish quality, and durability, while **raising the grain** prevents wood fibers from lifting when applying water-based finishes.

For best results, always sand in the direction of the grain, use protective gear, and consider the project requirements when choosing your tools and techniques.

> ***Tip:** Always protect yourself when sanding with protective glasses and a dusk mask.*

### Hand Sanding Tools

Hand sanding tools are ideal for precision work, tight spaces, or when you want more control over the sanding process.

#### **Sandpaper**

- Coated abrasive paper available in different grits. You can fold it or cut it into smaller pieces to use by hand. Check out the [grit guide](#grit-guide) below.
  - **Usage**: Use lower grit for aggressive sanding and higher grits for finishing
  - **Types**: Aluminum oxide (general use), silicon carbide (wet/dry), garnet (fine finishing)

   ![](/_images/_experimental-writing/sandpaper.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Sanding Block**

- A block used to hold sandpaper flat for even sanding. Cut a strip of sandpaper and attach to the sanding block. Fast & comfortable to use
  - **Usage**: Prevents uneven sanding and helps apply uniform pressure

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/sandingblock.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Sanding Sponge**

- Flexible sponge coated with abrasive material. No sandpaper needed as it's already on the sponge!
- **Usage**: Ideal for contours, curves, and irregular surfaces

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/sandingsponge.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

### Power Sanding Tools

Power tools make the sanding process quicker and are ideal for larger surfaces or more intensive sanding tasks.

#### **Orbital Sander**

- A handheld sander that moves in small circles. You can also get a random orbital sander, that moves randomly instead of in circles
  - **Usage**: General-purpose sanding, producing a fine finish with minimal swirl marks

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/orbitalsander.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Detail Sander**

- Small triangular-shaped sander
  - **Usage**: Designed for tight spaces, corners, and detailed work

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/detailsander.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Hand Drill & Dremel**

- Uses drum, disc or mop sanding attachments that fit into a dremel or drill. These can be found online.
  - **Usage**: Use when light sanding is required or the surface is quite soft. Mops are great to get into tight spaces to remove wood fuzz

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/dremel.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/dremelsandingbits.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Belt Sander**

- Uses a continuous loop of sandpaper. Can be a wide strip or thin wand unit
  - **Usage**: Best for removing large amounts of material quickly and levelling surfaces

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/beltsanders.jpg){.aligncenter size-medium}

#### **Stationary Disc & Belt Sanders**

- Uses a spinning disc of sandpaper, or a combo of belt and disc sandpaper. Can be mounted on a workbench or table
  - **Usage**: Suitable for rough sanding or shaping edges

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/beltdrumsandercombo2.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Drum Sander**

- A large, stationary sander with a rotating drum
  - **Usage**: Ideal for sanding large surfaces such as wooden floor boards. Great for removing old paint, varnish or discolourations and for levelling and smoothing large surfaces

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/drumsander.webp){.aligncenter .size-medium}

By choosing the right tool for each stage, you can achieve a high-quality finish on your woodworking projects.

### Choosing the right Grit

**Grit** refers to the particles of sand that make up the sandpaper. Larger, fewer particles with more space between them is coarse grit. The smaller and more packed together the particles, the finer the grit. Coarse sandpaper removes imperfections faster and with less effort than fine sandpaper – which is great if you are trying to shape or level. Fine grit is used for the later stages of wood sanding – for smoothing and polishing. The higher the sandpaper’s grit, the smoother the result. Begin with a coarser grit to level the wood, then buff scratches with finer grits until you reach the desired smoothness. It is important to move through the grits and not skip from a rough one, straight to a fine one.

***Tip**: The golden rule of sanding, is to move the sandpaper in the same direction as the wood grain. This reduces visible scratches and results in a smoother finish.*

### Grit Guide

| **Step**          | **Grit Level**    | **Purpose**                              |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Rough Sanding     | 60-100 grit       | Removes large burrs, rough edges.        |
| Medium Sanding    | 120-150 grit      | Smoothens the surface, removes tool marks. |
| Fine Sanding      | 220-320 grit      | Prepares for paint/stain, smooth texture. |

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Start with Rough Sanding (80-100 Grit):**  
   Use this grit to remove any visible tool marks or uneven surfaces created by the CNC machine. You can shape the wood a bit or break the edge if desired.

1. **Medium Sanding (120-150 Grit):**  
   Smooth out any remaining roughness, ensuring an even surface. Use an orbital sander or sanding block for flat surfaces.

1. **Fine Sanding (220-320 Grit):**  
   This grit is for a silky-smooth finish, ideal before applying paint, stain, or sealant. Do be aware that the higher the grit you use at this stage, will reduce the ability of stains and finished to penetrate the wood. If you are using 1000 grit for example, you are no longer cutting the wood, but packing sawdust into the wood pours, burnishing it. The surface will become shiny and very smooth, but not allow stain or seal to penetrate fully.

### Tips & Video Links

> **Safety Tips**: Wear protective gear (safety glasses, dust mask). Use a dust collection system or sand in a well-ventilated area.<br>

> **Tip**: For curved or intricate designs, consider using sanding sponges, soft pads, or hand sanding to access tight spaces. Depending on your project, getting into the crevices of your design can be difficult. Small scrapers are handy to remove fuzzy bits. What if you carved a 3d relief? Sanding mops in different grits work great here. They can get into the details without removing too much material and ruining the design.

## Advanced Sanding

### Raising the grain

Raising the grain is an essential step, especially when working with water-based finishes. The process involves initial sanding, wetting the wood, sanding again, then moving on to other finishing steps.

#### Why raise the grain?

When you apply water-based finishes or stains to wood, the wood fibers absorb moisture and swell, causing the grain to rise, which results in a rough texture. By raising the grain beforehand and sanding it smooth, you prevent this from happening after the finish or stain is applied, ensuring a smoother final result.

- **Prepares the wood**: Especially important when applying water-based stains, paints, or sealers.
- **Prevents rough surfaces**: Stops the grain from rising after the finish is applied, ensuring a smooth final result.

#### Raise the grain process

1. **Sand the Wood**
   Sand your wood project to a smooth finish using progressively finer grits of sandpaper (start with 120 grit and work up to 220 grit or finer).
   Make sure the surface is free of any visible scratches or rough spots.

1. **Moisten the Surface**
   Use a damp cloth to lightly moisten the surface of the wood with a clean, damp cloth. You don’t want to soak the wood, just enough moisture to slightly wet the surface. Make sure the water is put on evenly across the entire surface to raise the grain evenly.

1. **Allow the Wood to Dry**
   Let the surface to air-dry completely. This usually takes 1-2 hours, depending on the humidity. As the wood dries, the fibers will rise, creating a rough texture on the surface.

1. **Sand the Raised Grain (220-320 Grit)**
   Once the wood is completely dry, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper (320 or higher). The goal is to knock down the raised fibers without removing too much material or damaging the wood. Use light pressure and sand with the grain to avoid scratches. Feel the wood to ensure it’s smooth again.

1. **Continue with the Next Finishing Steps**
   After raising the grain and sanding it smooth, you can proceed to apply your stain or finish. Since you’ve pre-raised the grain, the finish or stain will go on smoother and result in a more even texture. Keep in mind:

   - Water-Based finishes tend to raise the grain more than oil-based finishes, so it’s especially important to raise the grain beforehand if you’re using water-based products.
   - Oil-based stains and finishes don't raise the grain as much, but it’s still a good practice to prepare the wood properly.

By raising the grain and sanding it smooth before finishing, you’ll end up with a much smoother and more professional finish, especially when using water-based products.

> **Tip**: Always raise the grain before applying water-based products to ensure a professional-looking finish.

Here is a video on raising the grain that is under 2 min. [Raise the grain!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CynRU6QIy28)<br>

### Break the edges

Breaking the edges is a common woodworking practice that serves several important purposes. The process involves a simple sanding of the sharp edges during or upon completion of your project, with a sanding block.

#### Why break the edges?

- **Safety and Comfort**
Sharp edges can be a safety hazard because they are more prone to chipping or breaking off during handling. Additionally, sharp edges can cut or cause splinters, making the finished piece less comfortable to touch or use.

- **Improved Finish Quality**
Sanding sharp edges helps paint, stain, or varnish adhere better. Sharp corners tend to accumulate excess finish, leading to uneven coverage. By softening the edges, you ensure that the finish is more evenly applied and visually appealing.

- **Reduced Risk of Tear-Out**
Sharp edges are more likely to experience tear-out, especially when cutting or routing. By slightly rounding or chamfering the edges, you reduce the chance of fibers breaking off, resulting in a cleaner look.

- **Aesthetic Appeal**
Softened or rounded edges often look more refined and professional compared to sharp edges. The softened profile can enhance the overall visual balance of the project and make the design appear more intentional and polished.

- **Longer Lifespan**
Rounded edges are less susceptible to damage from impact or wear and tear over time. This durability is especially important for furniture pieces or items that will experience regular use.

#### Break the edge process

To do this, simply use a medium or fine grit sanding block, to make a couple of passes over each sharp edge at a 45-degree angle. You can do this before assembly, and repeat until the edge is softened to your preference.

> ***Tip** A metal file is surprisingly good for breaking edges when you go to sand your wood*

Here is a great short video explaining why and how to break your edges in under 1 minute.

### Step-by-Step Painting Process

1. **Prepare the Surface**<br>
   - Remove Dust: Wipe down with a tack cloth to eliminate any dust left after sanding
   - Tape Applied: Mask off any areas you don't want the paint to go

1. **Prime the Surface** (Optional but Recommended):  
   - Choose the Right Primer: Use a stain-blocking primer if the wood is knotty or has discolorations<br>
   - Apply an Even Coat: Use a brush, following the wood grain <br>
   - Allow it to dry according to the manufacturer’s instructions<br>
   - Light Sanding: Once dry, sand lightly with 220-grit paper and wipe away dust<br>

1. **Apply Paint in Thin Layers**
   - Mix the Paint: Stir the paint thoroughly with a stir stick or shake the can
   - Apply the First Coat: Use a brush for detailed areas and a roller or spray paint for flat surfaces. Apply thin, even coats
   - Let it Dry: Allow the paint to dry completely (usually 4-6 hours or per instructions)
   - Sand Between Coats: Lightly sand with 220-grit sandpaper for a smooth finish, then wipe away dust
   - Apply Additional Coats: Repeat the process until you achieve the desired opacity and finish (typically 2-3 coats)

1. **Final Sanding (320-400 Grit)**
   - This helps smooth any imperfections or raised grain caused by moisture in the paint before applying the final coat

1. **Apply Final Coat**  
   - After applying the desired number of layers (typically 2-3), let the project dry completely before moving on to sealing

1. **Finishing Touches**
   - Remove Painter’s Tape: Carefully peel off the tape to reveal clean edges

## 4. Staining

Staining enhances the natural beauty of wood by bringing out its grain and adding rich color. There are different types of stains:

### Stain Types

| **Type of Stain**     | **Description**                               | **Best Used On**              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Oil-Based Stain       | Deep penetration, rich color.                 | Hardwood projects.            |
| Water-Based Stain     | Easy cleanup, less odor, quick drying.        | Softwood and general projects. |
| Gel Stain             | Sits on top, great for vertical applications. | Complex, detailed surfaces.    |

### Step-by-Step Staining Process

1. **Pre-Stain Conditioner (Optional but Recommended):**  
   Use a wood conditioner on softwoods (e.g., pine, maple) to ensure even stain absorption.

1. **Apply Stain with a Brush or Cloth**:  
   Work the stain into the wood, following the grain. Wipe away excess after 5-10 minutes.

1. **Let the Stain Dry**:  
   Allow at least 4-6 hours (oil-based) or 1-2 hours (water-based) before applying a second coat or moving to the sealing stage.

1. **Apply Additional Coats (Optional)**:  
   If you want a deeper color, you can apply multiple coats, allowing full drying between each.

Finishing a wood CNC project for indoor use involves several steps to ensure a polished look and durability. Here’s a guide to help you through the process:

1. Preparation

1. Sanding
Choose Your Grit: Start with a coarser grit (like 120) and gradually move to finer grits (up to 220 or higher).
Sand the Edges and Surfaces: Sand all visible surfaces and edges to achieve a smooth finish. Pay special attention to corners and curves.
1. Sealing (Optional)
Apply a Wood Conditioner: If you’re using softwoods or uneven-grained woods, consider applying a wood conditioner to promote even stain absorption.
1. Staining (Optional)
Choose the Right Stain: Select a stain that complements your wood. Test on a scrap piece to see how the color looks once dried.
Apply Stain Evenly: Use a brush or cloth to apply the stain. Wipe off excess after a few minutes to achieve your desired shade.
Allow to Dry: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for drying times.
1. Finishing
Select a Finish: Choose a finish suitable for indoor use, such as polyurethane, lacquer, or oil. Polyurethane is durable and available in different sheens (matte, satin, gloss).
Apply the Finish: Use a brush, roller, or cloth to apply a thin coat of your chosen finish. Be sure to apply it in the direction of the grain.
Sand Between Coats: Once the first coat is dry (check drying times), lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper (320 or higher) to ensure good adhesion for subsequent coats.
Apply Additional Coats: Repeat the application and sanding process for at least 2-3 coats, depending on the finish and desired durability.
1. Final Touches
Inspect the Finish: After the final coat, check for any imperfections and lightly sand if necessary.
Buff (if applicable): For certain finishes, you might want to buff the surface with a soft cloth to enhance the shine.
1. Curing
Let it Cure: Allow the finished piece to cure fully before use. This could take several days to a week, depending on the finish used.
1. Maintenance
Regular Cleaning: Use a soft, damp cloth to clean your finished piece. Avoid harsh chemicals that could damage the finish.
By following these steps, you can achieve a beautiful and durable finish for your wood CNC project!

The primary difference between spar urethane and polyurethane lies in their intended use and specific properties. Here's a breakdown:

1. Intended Use
Spar Urethane: Originally developed for marine applications, spar urethane is designed to protect wood in outdoor environments. It's commonly used on outdoor furniture, boats, decks, and any wood exposed to harsh elements like moisture, UV rays, and temperature changes.
Polyurethane: Typically used for indoor wood projects, polyurethane is ideal for furniture, floors, cabinetry, and other indoor wood surfaces that need protection from wear, moisture, and heat.
1. UV Protection
Spar Urethane: Contains UV inhibitors that protect wood from sun damage, making it ideal for outdoor use where the wood is exposed to sunlight. This prevents fading, cracking, and degradation from UV rays.
Polyurethane: Lacks UV protection and is more susceptible to damage and discoloration if exposed to direct sunlight for prolonged periods.
1. Flexibility
Spar Urethane: More flexible than polyurethane. This flexibility allows the finish to expand and contract with the wood in response to changes in temperature and humidity, which is critical for outdoor wood exposed to varying weather conditions.
Polyurethane: Harder and more rigid once cured, which works well for indoor projects where the wood doesn’t experience significant expansion or contraction.
1. Durability
Spar Urethane: While spar urethane is more resistant to weather conditions, it is generally softer and less durable to physical wear (scratches, dents) than polyurethane.
Polyurethane: Provides a harder, more durable surface that resists scratches, abrasions, and wear, making it ideal for high-traffic areas like floors or furniture.
1. Moisture Resistance
Spar Urethane: Has a higher resistance to moisture, making it suitable for outdoor projects exposed to rain, snow, or humidity.
Polyurethane: While polyurethane provides good moisture resistance, it is not typically recommended for long-term exposure to outdoor conditions or standing water.
1. Application
Spar Urethane: Usually applied in multiple thin coats, often requiring more careful application because it’s slower drying, especially in humid conditions.
Polyurethane: Easier to apply indoors, dries faster, and often requires fewer coats than spar urethane. Available in both oil-based and water-based forms.
1. Appearance
Spar Urethane: Tends to have a glossier finish due to its flexibility, but it may yellow slightly over time, especially in oil-based versions.
Polyurethane: Available in various finishes, including matte, satin, semi-gloss, and gloss. Oil-based polyurethane can also yellow with age, but water-based polyurethane remains clear.
Summary:
Spar Urethane: Best for outdoor projects needing UV protection, moisture resistance, and flexibility.
Polyurethane: Best for indoor projects requiring a hard, durable finish that resists scratches and wear.
If you're finishing an indoor CNC wood project, polyurethane is typically the better choice, unless the piece will be exposed to direct sunlight, in which case you might consider spar urethane for added UV protection.

There are several types of wood stains, each with unique properties and uses. Here’s a breakdown of the most common types:

Spray painting wood can result in a smooth and professional-looking finish, but one of the common challenges is paint bleed, where the paint seeps into unwanted areas or results in an uneven application. Here’s a guide on how to prevent spray paint bleed and achieve clean, crisp results on wood.

1. Prepare the Wood Surface Properly
Sand the Wood: Ensure the wood surface is smooth by sanding it with fine-grit sandpaper (start with 120 and move to 220). Rough wood can lead to uneven paint absorption and contribute to bleeding.
Clean the Surface: After sanding, clean the wood thoroughly to remove dust, debris, and oils that might affect paint adhesion. Use a tack cloth or a lint-free cloth dampened with water or mineral spirits.
1. Use a Primer or Sealer
Seal the Wood: Applying a primer or wood sealer is key to preventing paint bleed. Wood is porous, and unsealed wood can absorb paint unevenly, causing it to bleed.
Use a Quality Primer: Choose a primer compatible with your spray paint (either water- or oil-based) and apply an even coat. This will help create a barrier between the wood grain and the paint.
Sand After Priming: Lightly sand the primed surface with fine sandpaper (320 grit) after it has dried. This will smooth out any raised grain or imperfections.
1. Mask Off Areas Carefully
Use Painter’s Tape: To prevent bleed around edges or patterns, use high-quality painter’s tape specifically designed for wood. Ensure the tape is firmly pressed down along the edges to avoid gaps where the paint could seep through.
Use a Clear Coat Barrier: Before applying spray paint, consider spraying a thin coat of clear sealer or varnish over the taped edges. This helps to seal the tape's edge, preventing the colored paint from bleeding underneath.
Remove the Tape Properly: After spraying, wait until the paint is tacky but not fully dry, then carefully remove the tape at an angle to prevent lifting paint.
1. Spray Paint with Care
Use Thin Coats: Apply multiple thin coats of spray paint rather than one thick coat. Thicker applications are more prone to bleeding as the excess paint can seep into cracks or unsealed wood.
Maintain Proper Distance: Hold the spray can 8-12 inches away from the surface and move it in smooth, sweeping motions to avoid oversaturating any area.
Check for Drips: Watch for drips and runs during application, as they can lead to uneven coverage and bleed.
1. Consider Using a Paint Stencil Adhesive
If you're using stencils for designs, use stencil adhesive or low-tack adhesive spray to secure the stencil tightly to the wood. This ensures clean lines and prevents the paint from seeping under the edges of the stencil.
1. Allow Proper Drying Between Coats
Dry Between Layers: Let each coat of spray paint dry completely before applying the next one. Rushing the process can cause the paint to smear or bleed, particularly in areas that are still wet.
1. Finish with a Topcoat
Seal the Paint: After the final coat of spray paint, consider sealing the surface with a clear protective topcoat (such as polyurethane or lacquer). This not only enhances durability but also prevents any future bleed or fading.
By following these steps, you can effectively prevent spray paint bleed on wood and achieve a clean, professional finish. Proper preparation, careful masking, and applying the paint in thin, even coats are key to controlling the outcome.
