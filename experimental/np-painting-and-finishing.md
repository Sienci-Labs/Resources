guide on painting and finishing CNC projects

A general “Finishing” page in the “Handbook” section would be very beneficial to those who are less familiar with sanding, selecting stains or clearcoats, painting, and other aspects of finishing off your average CNC project

Preventing bleed on spray paint
What I do is:
Stain
Clear Coat
Mask
Carve
Spray clear coat the carve area to seal the grain vessels ( I usually do 3-4 light coats from various angles giving each coat a few minutes to dry) Oh and I use Water Based Poly for both clear coat applications, usually wipe on type for the first application before… .
Then after that’s dry I’ll Spay Paint
Then let it dry
Then peel the masking

I never get bleeding into the grain with this method.
