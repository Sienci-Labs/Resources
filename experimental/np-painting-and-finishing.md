## 1. Sanding

Sanding is crucial to smooth out rough edges left by the CNC process and prepare the surface for painting or staining. Here's a step-by-step sanding process:

### Sanding Grit Guide:
| **Step**          | **Grit Level**    | **Purpose**                              |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Rough Sanding     | 80-100 grit       | Removes large burrs, rough edges.        |
| Medium Sanding    | 120-150 grit      | Smoothens the surface, removes tool marks. |
| Fine Sanding      | 220-320 grit      | Prepares for paint/stain, smooth texture. |

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Start with Rough Sanding (80-100 Grit):**  
   Use this grit to remove any visible tool marks or uneven surfaces created by the CNC machine.
   
2. **Medium Sanding (120-150 Grit):**  
   Smooth out any remaining roughness, ensuring an even surface. Use an orbital sander or sanding block for flat surfaces.
   
3. **Fine Sanding (220-320 Grit):**  
   This grit is for a silky-smooth finish, ideal before applying paint, stain, or sealant.

> **Tip**: For curved or intricate designs, consider using sanding sponges, soft pads, or hand sanding to access tight spaces.

## 2. Raising the Grain

Raising the grain is an essential step, especially when working with water-based finishes. The process involves initial sanding, wetting the wood, sanding again, then moving on to other finishing steps.

### Why Raise the Grain?
When you apply water-based finishes or stains to wood, the wood fibers absorb moisture and swell, causing the grain to rise, which results in a rough texture. By raising the grain beforehand and sanding it smooth, you prevent this from happening after the finish or stain is applied, ensuring a smoother final result.
- **Prepares the wood**: Especially important when applying water-based stains, paints, or sealers.
- **Prevents rough surfaces**: Stops the grain from rising after the finish is applied, ensuring a smooth final result.

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Moisten the Surface**:  
   Use a damp cloth to lightly moisten the surface of the wood with a clean, damp cloth. You don’t want to soak the wood, just enough moisture to slightly wet the surface. Make sure the water is put on evenly across the entire surface to raise the grain evenly.

2. **Allow the Wood to Dry**:  
   Let the surface to air-dry completely. This usually takes 1-2 hours, depending on the humidity. As the wood dries, the fibers will rise, creating a rough texture on the surface.

3. **Sand the Raised Grain (220-320 Grit)**:  
   Once dry, lightly sand the surface to smooth out the raised fibers. Be gentle to avoid removing too much material.

4. **Continue with the Next Finishing Steps**:  
   After sanding, you can proceed with your usual finishing process like painting, staining, or sealing.

> **Tip**: Always raise the grain before applying water-based products to ensure a professional-looking finish.

How to Raise the Grain
Initial Sanding

Start by sanding the wood: Sand your wood project to a smooth finish using progressively finer grits of sandpaper (start with 120 grit and work up to 220 grit or finer).
Make sure the surface is free of any visible scratches or rough spots.
Moisten the Wood



Let it dry naturally: 
Light Sanding

Lightly sand the raised grain: Once the wood is completely dry, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper (320 or higher). The goal is to knock down the raised fibers without removing too much material or damaging the wood.
Sand gently: Use light pressure and sand with the grain to avoid scratches.
Check the surface: Feel the wood to ensure it’s smooth again.
Repeat if Necessary

For water-based finishes: If you plan to use a water-based finish, consider raising the grain and sanding it down again to be certain that the wood fibers won't rise when you apply the finish.
Proceed with Staining or Finishing
After raising the grain and sanding it smooth, you can proceed to apply your stain or finish. Since you’ve pre-raised the grain, the finish or stain will go on smoother and result in a more even texture. Keep in mind:

Water-Based Finishes: These tend to raise the grain more than oil-based finishes, so it’s especially important to raise the grain beforehand if you’re using water-based products.
Oil-Based Finishes: Oil-based stains and finishes don't raise the grain as much, but it’s still a good practice to prepare the wood properly.
By raising the grain and sanding it smooth before finishing, you’ll end up with a much smoother and more professional finish, especially when using water-based products.

|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Acrylic Paint       | Matte/Satin/Gloss    | Small to medium projects, easy application. |
| Spray Paint         | Smooth, Glossy       | Large areas, quick coverage.             |
| Latex Paint         | Matte or Gloss       | Projects requiring durability and flexibility. |

### Step-by-Step Painting Process:
1. **Prime the Surface** (Optional but Recommended):  
   Use a primer to help the paint adhere better and cover the natural wood grain.

2. **Apply Paint in Thin Layers**:  
   Use a brush or spray in even, thin coats. Allow drying between coats (typically 1-2 hours, depending on the paint).

3. **Light Sanding Between Coats (320-400 Grit)**:  
   This helps smooth any imperfections or raised grain caused by moisture in the paint.

4. **Apply Final Coat**:  
   After applying the desired number of layers (typically 2-3), let the project dry completely before moving on to sealing.

| Gel Stain             | Sits on top, great for vertical applications. | Complex, detailed surfaces.    |

### Step-by-Step Staining Process:
1. **Pre-Stain Conditioner (Optional but Recommended):**  
   Use a wood conditioner on softwoods (e.g., pine, maple) to ensure even stain absorption.

2. **Apply Stain with a Brush or Cloth**:  
   Work the stain into the wood, following the grain. Wipe away excess after 5-10 minutes.

3. **Let the Stain Dry**:  
   Allow at least 4-6 hours (oil-based) or 1-2 hours (water-based) before applying a second coat or moving to the sealing stage.

4. **Apply Additional Coats (Optional)**:  
   If you want a deeper color, you can apply multiple coats, allowing full drying between each.

The primary difference between spar urethane and polyurethane lies in their intended use and specific properties. Here's a breakdown:

1. Intended Use
Spar Urethane: Originally developed for marine applications, spar urethane is designed to protect wood in outdoor environments. It's commonly used on outdoor furniture, boats, decks, and any wood exposed to harsh elements like moisture, UV rays, and temperature changes.
Polyurethane: Typically used for indoor wood projects, polyurethane is ideal for furniture, floors, cabinetry, and other indoor wood surfaces that need protection from wear, moisture, and heat.
2. UV Protection
Spar Urethane: Contains UV inhibitors that protect wood from sun damage, making it ideal for outdoor use where the wood is exposed to sunlight. This prevents fading, cracking, and degradation from UV rays.
Polyurethane: Lacks UV protection and is more susceptible to damage and discoloration if exposed to direct sunlight for prolonged periods.
3. Flexibility
Spar Urethane: More flexible than polyurethane. This flexibility allows the finish to expand and contract with the wood in response to changes in temperature and humidity, which is critical for outdoor wood exposed to varying weather conditions.
Polyurethane: Harder and more rigid once cured, which works well for indoor projects where the wood doesn’t experience significant expansion or contraction.
4. Durability
Spar Urethane: While spar urethane is more resistant to weather conditions, it is generally softer and less durable to physical wear (scratches, dents) than polyurethane.
Polyurethane: Provides a harder, more durable surface that resists scratches, abrasions, and wear, making it ideal for high-traffic areas like floors or furniture.
5. Moisture Resistance
Spar Urethane: Has a higher resistance to moisture, making it suitable for outdoor projects exposed to rain, snow, or humidity.
Polyurethane: While polyurethane provides good moisture resistance, it is not typically recommended for long-term exposure to outdoor conditions or standing water.
6. Application
Spar Urethane: Usually applied in multiple thin coats, often requiring more careful application because it’s slower drying, especially in humid conditions.
Polyurethane: Easier to apply indoors, dries faster, and often requires fewer coats than spar urethane. Available in both oil-based and water-based forms.
7. Appearance
Spar Urethane: Tends to have a glossier finish due to its flexibility, but it may yellow slightly over time, especially in oil-based versions.
Polyurethane: Available in various finishes, including matte, satin, semi-gloss, and gloss. Oil-based polyurethane can also yellow with age, but water-based polyurethane remains clear.
Summary:
Spar Urethane: Best for outdoor projects needing UV protection, moisture resistance, and flexibility.
Polyurethane: Best for indoor projects requiring a hard, durable finish that resists scratches and wear.
If you're finishing an indoor CNC wood project, polyurethane is typically the better choice, unless the piece will be exposed to direct sunlight, in which case you might consider spar urethane for added UV protection.

Spray painting wood can result in a smooth and professional-looking finish, but one of the common challenges is paint bleed, where the paint seeps into unwanted areas or results in an uneven application. Here’s a guide on how to prevent spray paint bleed and achieve clean, crisp results on wood.

1. Prepare the Wood Surface Properly
Sand the Wood: Ensure the wood surface is smooth by sanding it with fine-grit sandpaper (start with 120 and move to 220). Rough wood can lead to uneven paint absorption and contribute to bleeding.
Clean the Surface: After sanding, clean the wood thoroughly to remove dust, debris, and oils that might affect paint adhesion. Use a tack cloth or a lint-free cloth dampened with water or mineral spirits.
2. Use a Primer or Sealer
Seal the Wood: Applying a primer or wood sealer is key to preventing paint bleed. Wood is porous, and unsealed wood can absorb paint unevenly, causing it to bleed.
Use a Quality Primer: Choose a primer compatible with your spray paint (either water- or oil-based) and apply an even coat. This will help create a barrier between the wood grain and the paint.
Sand After Priming: Lightly sand the primed surface with fine sandpaper (320 grit) after it has dried. This will smooth out any raised grain or imperfections.
3. Mask Off Areas Carefully
Use Painter’s Tape: To prevent bleed around edges or patterns, use high-quality painter’s tape specifically designed for wood. Ensure the tape is firmly pressed down along the edges to avoid gaps where the paint could seep through.
Use a Clear Coat Barrier: Before applying spray paint, consider spraying a thin coat of clear sealer or varnish over the taped edges. This helps to seal the tape's edge, preventing the colored paint from bleeding underneath.
Remove the Tape Properly: After spraying, wait until the paint is tacky but not fully dry, then carefully remove the tape at an angle to prevent lifting paint.
4. Spray Paint with Care
Use Thin Coats: Apply multiple thin coats of spray paint rather than one thick coat. Thicker applications are more prone to bleeding as the excess paint can seep into cracks or unsealed wood.
Maintain Proper Distance: Hold the spray can 8-12 inches away from the surface and move it in smooth, sweeping motions to avoid oversaturating any area.
Check for Drips: Watch for drips and runs during application, as they can lead to uneven coverage and bleed.
5. Consider Using a Paint Stencil Adhesive
If you're using stencils for designs, use stencil adhesive or low-tack adhesive spray to secure the stencil tightly to the wood. This ensures clean lines and prevents the paint from seeping under the edges of the stencil.
6. Allow Proper Drying Between Coats
Dry Between Layers: Let each coat of spray paint dry completely before applying the next one. Rushing the process can cause the paint to smear or bleed, particularly in areas that are still wet.
7. Finish with a Topcoat
Seal the Paint: After the final coat of spray paint, consider sealing the surface with a clear protective topcoat (such as polyurethane or lacquer). This not only enhances durability but also prevents any future bleed or fading.
By following these steps, you can effectively prevent spray paint bleed on wood and achieve a clean, professional finish. Proper preparation, careful masking, and applying the paint in thin, even coats are key to controlling the outcome.
