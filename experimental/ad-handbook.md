It would be good to review how the utility of the 'Handbook' section for the MK2 is looking. It should include aspects that:

- Cover any of the common information that a user might need for day-to-day operation of their machine once it's been set up
- Talk with users or try to imagine yourself what sort of content you tend to need to reference while cutting, things like job setup, maintenance, common fixes
- Shouldn't include any basic concepts (though pages on basic concepts can be linked to) since 'The Basics' and 'Software' make up their own sections

Actionable items:

- Running jobs page could use more elaboration in places, and pictures
- Mention how to handle safe heights regularly vs with the Vortex
- How to zero in different scenarios or find zero on a piece of round stock or in stock center
  - Great video idea but thereâ€™s a much easier way to do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6TMRDtXMGA
- Mention in surfacing page that it's useful for flatten material for v-carving to keep text at a consistent depth
- Your MK2, write section on how to identify your LongMill model
