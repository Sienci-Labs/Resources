CNCs can create a lot of mess just like many other cutting tools. Think about the chips and fine dust you get drilling a single hole or cutting a piece of wood in half and then stretch that out over hours of constant cutting on a cnc machine. Not only does this make a mess, but it's not good for your health to breath in.

This is where dust collection helps out. Most woodworkers will setup a dust collection system that can quickly connect to whatever tool or machine they are using at the time. Most cnc dust collection systems consist of a **dust shoe** where the cutting is happening, a **hose** to cary the dust and a **dust collector**.

Let's explore options you have to:

- Read about keeping yourself protected in the [Safety](#safety) section
- See which [Dust Shoes](#dust-shoes) will fit your system best
- Explore how to select and hang your [Hose](#hose-size)
- Compare [Dust Collection](#2-dust-collector) options available
- Check out some [User Setups](#user-setups)


### Safety

Being in an environment where you are exposed to high amounts of aerosolized sawdust isn't good for you, and can cause a chronic cough, chest pain, runny nose, headaches, bronchitis and more. The worst for your health is the fine particle that can't be seen by the naked eye. In the woodworking hobby, dust is classified into categories—L (low-risk), M (medium-risk), and H (high-risk)—based on the type of material and associated health risks.

- L-Class (Low Risk) – Minimal health risk but requires basic dust control.

  - Softwoods (pine, cedar) – Respiratory irritants but low toxicity.
  - Plastics – Sanding dust can cause irritation but is generally low risk.
- M-Class (Medium Risk) – Higher respiratory hazards; requires enhanced filtration.

  - Hardwoods (oak, beech) – Fine dust can trigger allergies and long-term issues.
  - Plywood/MDF – Releases formaldehyde and chemicals when cut or sanded.
  - Painted/coated surfaces – May contain toxic compounds like lead. *Use caution when surfacing an old painted piece of wood for example*

- H-Class (High Risk) – Carcinogenic/toxic materials; requires specialized protection.

  - Asbestos – Extremely hazardous; causes lung diseases.
  - Silica dust (from concrete, tile, stone) – Leads to silicosis if inhaled. *Be careful carving an old tile for example*

 You can protect yourself on 3 basic levels.

 1. Your nose and mouth should be covered with a high quality dust mask or respirator with a minimum rating of N95. This prevents dust from entering your body at all.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_dust_safety_face.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

 1. Your project should have a good dust collector, to remove as much dust at the source as possible, before the particles have the chance to become airborne. This type of protection 'collects' the dust at the source.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_dust_safety_collect.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

 1. Your workshop can add more protection against those fine particles by using a dust extraction system to catch any particles your dust collector misses. This type of protection 'extracts' fine dust particles from the air in your shop.

 ![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_dust_safety_extract.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

 Regularly cleaning work surfaces, machines, and the floor will help minimize any dust that could be kicked up by new projects.
  Working with a door open or an exhaust fan in a well ventilated area is also a great way to reduce your exposure to hazardous fine sawdust materials.

  ***Note: Don't mix metal shavings with wood dust as it can cause a fire hazard and ruin your hose***

## Dust Shoes

A **dust shoe** is basically a fancy vacuum attachment for your CNC machine, it stays near the cutter to stop chips and fine dust from flying away while the **vacuum system** pulls it all away. This is good for you because it:

- can give you cleaner cuts with the debris out of the way
- reduces maintenance since dirt build-up can cause premature wear on many CNCs
- saves you time cleaning up that you'd have to do anyway
- keeps your shop air cleaner which is safer for your lungs

That said, dust management can still come in other forms like building an [enclosure for your CNC](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-table-enclosure/#machine-enclosure) or cutting outside. You might choose to do these if you:

- are worried about the noise from running a vacuum or dust collector (though the noise of cutting can get similarly loud)
- don't want to deal with the dust shoe colliding with clamps, material, or getting in the way during tool changes

### Fixed vs. Adjustable Dust Shoes

The design of your dust shoe can greatly affect how well it collects dust for you particular application. There are hundreds of different designs for dust shoes, however, one of the largest differentiators is whether it is fixed or adjustable. These two styles are also sometimes referred to as Z-axis dependent / bound / tethered vs. Z-axis independent / unbound / free.

Whether a dust shoe is fixed or adjustable depends on how it’s mounted:

- A fixed-style dust shoe is mounted to the Z-axis or the router body on the CNC. This means that when the Z-axis moves up or down during cutting the dust shoe moves up and down with it.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_dust_boot_fixed.jpg "Source - https://community.carbide3d.com/t/hall-of-dust-shoes/7717/20?page=2, https://maniacallabs.com/2019/02/25/cnc-dust-boot-for-dewalt-router/"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

- An adjustable-style dust shoe is typically mounted to the X-axis of the CNC. This means that it never moves unless you change it's height, allowing the Z-axis to raise and plunge during cutting while the dust shoe stays in the spot you set it. It can be secured with a couple bolts as in the left image, or held in place with strong magnets for quick and easy adjustments as shown in the right image below.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_dust_boot_adjustable.jpg "Source - https://www.nymolabs.com/products/cnc-dust-shoe-only-for-nbs-6040-nbx-5040"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

For general purpose cutting, we recommend using an adjustable dust shoe as it is significantly better at collecting dust and debris, and relies less on how powerful your vacuum system is. It's also much better suited toward flat or sheet material which is the type of material that's most commonly used by hobby CNC users for sign-making and v-carving.

## Hose Size

Your shop vac or dust collector will come with a hose of a certain diameter. Your system will work most optimally if you use hoses that are similar in diameter.

CFM (cubic feet per minute) denotes the amount of air your vacuum can pass through. The higher the CFM, the more volume of material you can move. You will want a higher CFM rating if you are cutting a large amount of material.

Suction power (sometimes called Water Lift, Static Lift, Static Pressure…) indicates how fast the air is moving through the system. The higher your suction is, the harder the dust is pulled through your dust shoe and hose. You will typically want a higher suction vacuum if you are cutting heavier materials like metals, need to draw chips out of narrow cuts, or are using a fixed-style dust shoe.

Dust collectors for example typically have higher CFMs but lower suction power, thus better suited with larger diameter hoses. Using a smaller diameter hose can constrict airflow and reduce its efficiency.

Shop-Vacs, on the other hand, have smaller CFMs but higher suction power. These types of vacuums are happy with using smaller diameter hoses.

Depending on the design of your dust shoe, you may need to adapt your hose to match. You can find adapters that can help switch between hose diameters. You may also want to opt for a hose that will keep static buildup along it's length to a minimum in which case more specialized options exist such as the [36mm antistatic hose from Festool](https://www.festoolcanada.com/accessories/dust-extraction/suction-hoses-and-cleaning-accessories/suction-hoses/204923---d3632x3,5m-asr).

### Hanging Your Hose

It's important to have the dust collection hose hang above the dust shoe, so that it doesn't put any pressure on the router, or get caught up in your work. You can simply hang it from the ceiling or use a more advanced solution like an articulating arm. Make your own, or [grab one from Etsy!](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/736098852/vacuum-hose-boom-for-small-medium-and)

## Choosing a Vacuum or Dust collector

Your dust shoe and hose will need a source of suction. Most times an existing dust collector or Shop-Vac with a [cyclone separator](#adding-a-cyclone-to-your-shop-vac) will be able to fit the bill since these systems are set up to run for many hours and provide reasonable suction. Depending on the dust shoe used and the hosing size you use for your shop, you may want to look at your system’s CFM and suction lift specifications depending on your needs.

### 1. Shop Vac

A **shop vac** is a versatile, high-suction device primarily designed to pick up larger particles, such as wood chips, sawdust, and even liquid spills. It is the most common type of dust collection used in the hobby CNC space. With many affordable options available at many large box stores, you can get setup and running right away with a shop vac. You can move it around the CNC or build a dedicated space for it.

- **Power and Filtration**: Shop vacs provide high suction power but often lack fine filtration. Many have basic or HEPA filters, which helps capture some finer dust, but they are generally more effective at picking up heavier, larger debris. Great for a small to medium CNC.
- **Airflow (CFM)**: Shop vacs typically operate at lower cubic feet per minute (CFM) airflow, often ranging between 100-200 CFM. This is sufficient for spot-cleaning work areas and individual tools.
- **Portability**: Shop vacs are small, lightweight, and portable, making them easy to move around for cleaning various areas of the workshop. Some users keep it in the same spot to reach both their tools and their CNC. Some even make a 'sound reducing' box around the entire vacuum.
- **Best Use**: Ideal for smaller to mid size CNC machines, especially when wanting higher suction to remove chips from deep cuts or heavier materials like metal.

### 2. Dust Collector

A **dust collector** is designed to capture large volumes of dust and wood chips from large CNCs & woodworking tools, particularly those that generate large amounts of debris. It is a more powerful and specialized system compared to a shop vac. It is stationary and often runs to more than one tool.

- **Power and Filtration**: Dust collectors focus on high airflow (CFM), typically ranging from 400-1,000 CFM or higher. They use large collection bags or drums and are often equipped with filters that capture dust down to 1-5 microns, though some higher-end units have finer filtration or HEPA options.
- **Airflow (CFM)**: With significantly higher CFM, dust collectors are capable of handling the dust output from larger machines, like table saws, planers, and jointers, where a high volume of air is needed to capture dust at the source.
- **Stationary Setup**: Dust collectors are usually larger and stationary or semi-stationary units. They often involve ductwork to connect multiple tools, providing centralized dust management in the shop.
- **Best Use**: Ideal for large CNC machines like the 48X30 LongMill or AltMill, woodworking shops with larger power tools, capturing high volumes of sawdust and debris from continuous operation.

### Features Comparison

| Feature              | Shop Vac                    | Dust Extractor                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Suction Power**    | High suction, lower airflow | Moderate suction and airflow    |
| **Filtration**       | Basic or HEPA; limited fine dust capture | HEPA filtration for very fine dust |
| **Airflow (CFM)**    | 100-200 CFM                 | 400-1000 CFM                    |
| **Portability**      | Portable                    | Portable and tool-compatible    |
| **Best For**         | Spot cleaning, larger debris | Fine, hazardous dust from sanding and concrete |

### Choosing the Right Tool

- **Use a Shop Vac** if you need portability and versatility for general cleanup or larger wood particles and debris. Most people start here as it is most economical and simple to setup and get going.
- **Choose a Dust Collector** if you have a dedicated woodworking shop with stationary tools and need continuous dust collection. If you are already a woodworker and have a shop, you may already have one of these.

Each of these tools has its strengths, costs, size and power requirements. Often woodworkers start with a simple shop vac and build up to a combination of shop vac & cyclone or a dust collector system. Add in a dust extractor to your shop, and you've created an optimal setup for a safer, cleaner workshop.

### Adding a Cyclone to your shop vac

Adding a second stage to your dust collection strategy can drastically reduce the amount of filters your shop vac or dust collection system uses. Often called a cyclone, it works by using centrifugal force to separate dust and debris from the air. When dust-laden air enters the cyclone chamber, it is spun rapidly in a vortex. The heavier particles are flung outward against the chamber walls, where they lose momentum and fall into a collection bin below. Meanwhile, the lighter, cleaner air is directed upwards and exits through the top outlet, often passing through a secondary filter for finer particles. This process improves efficiency, reduces filter clogging, and extends the lifespan of the dust collection system.

Many user will make their own, or you can purchase a pre-made one. [Here](https://www.leevalley.com/en-ca/shop/tools/workshop/dust-collection/dust-extractors/116856-dust-deputy-low-pro-deluxe) is a neat low profile cyclone!

### Adding a Dust Extractor to your shop

A **dust extractor** is a specialized type of vacuum designed to capture fine, hazardous dust, often with more precise filtration systems than typical shop vacs. Dust extractors are especially useful for capturing finer particles, such as those from sanding or cutting engineered woods, concrete, or other materials that release smaller, respirable dust. *A dust extraction system is used in your shop, not on your CNC.*

- **Power and Filtration**: Dust extractors typically come with HEPA filtration or very fine filters capable of capturing particles as small as 0.3 microns, which is essential for protecting respiratory health.
- **Airflow (CFM)**: Dust extractors usually have moderate CFM, around 100-200, similar to shop vacs, but the focus is on high-quality filtration rather than raw suction power. Many models also have automatic filter-cleaning features.
- **Portability**: They are generally portable and compact, making them easy to connect directly to handheld tools (like sanders or circular saws) for on-tool dust collection.
- **Best Use**: Dust extractors are best suited for capturing fine dust particles from sanding, concrete grinding, or other tasks that create hazardous, respirable dust.

### Sawdust Recycling

Sawdust from a woodworking shop has a surprising number of useful applications. Mix with wax for a camping fire starter or mix with wood glue to make art. Mulch your flower beds or make a bed for your livestock. What ever you do, don't throw it all away!

- **Wood Filler**: Combine sawdust with wood glue to fill in gaps or cracks in woodworking projects. You can often match the colour of the project if you use sawdust from that project.
- **Absorbent Material**: Sawdust soaks up spills well, making it useful for cleaning up oil or paint spills.
- **Mulch**: Sawdust can be spread around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds. Just be cautious with hardwood sawdust, as it can deplete nitrogen from the soil.
- **Compost**: Mix sawdust with other organic matter to create a rich compost. Be mindful of the wood type; avoid sawdust from treated wood.
- **Pathways**: It creates a soft, natural-looking walkway and prevents muddy paths in gardens.
- **Animal Bedding**: Use sawdust as bedding for small animals, chickens, or livestock. Be careful with aromatic woods like cedar, which might irritate some animals.
- **Wood Stain**: Darker sawdust can be boiled in water to create a natural stain.
- **Molded Wood Projects**: Mixing sawdust with resin or glue can create a wood-based composite for small molded items.
