Congratulations on receiving your new Vortex Rotary Axis! Check out our unboxing and assembly video or continue reading below.

https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=AEDRXNzc2PE

When you open up the box:

<ul>
  <li>You will find 2 hardware boxes
<ul>
  <li>The <b>first box</b> contains most of the parts that are made out of metal, including the headstock and tailstock bodies and the stepper motor that powers the rotary axis</li>
  <li>The <b>second box</b> contains a lot of the plastic components of the Vortex together with a hardware bag that contains fasteners among other smaller parts</li>
</ul>
</li>
  <li>In between the 2 boxes are 2 Styrofoam pieces that fill the void and also houses the chuck</li>
  <li>At the very bottom you will find 1 or 2 track pieces depending on the configuration ordered, wrapped in cardboard</li>
</ul>

Before you start assembly, you will want to take the 2 boxes and the Styrofoam piece that contains the chuck out of the packaging and place them in your assembly area. You can set the track(s) aside for now.

## Tools You‚Äôll Need

You‚Äôll need these tools on hand for assembly. Most people will have these in their shop and there is a size 4 Allen key that comes with your Vortex kit:

<ul>
  <li>Metric Allen key size 4</li>
  <li>Phillips screwdriver #2</li>
  <li>Metric Allen key size 6 or Imperial Size 7/32‚Äù</li>
  <li>#8 wood screws</li>
</ul>

## Missing/Broken Parts?

We got you ‚Äì your kit has spares and redundancy included. If a part is lost or isn‚Äôt going together how you expect, no worries; just check through the bags and you‚Äôll likely find what you need to continue assembly. Expect a couple of bolts left over at the end and feel free to set these aside for future machine maintenance.

We supply extra parts so that:

<ul>
  <li>If a part doesn‚Äôt work properly the extra one can be used instead</li>
  <li>If you lose something (especially small things) you don‚Äôt have to search the floor</li>
  <li>We reduce the chance of packing too few on our end</li>
</ul>

If a part is missing completely, check that you‚Äôre looking for the right thing and ensure you look through all the packaging you received with your Vortex.

If a part arrives broken and doesn‚Äôt have a spare, the Vortex‚Äôs warranty covers replacement parts and we‚Äôll even be happy to help you out if you break it yourself. Just shoot us a message here (https://sienci.com/contact-us/) and we‚Äôll get back to you as soon as we can.

## Assembly Tips

<ol>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
  <li><b>Read the instructions</b>
Many issues during assembly can be solved by re-examining the instructions. Check that you didn‚Äôt skip a page and that you completed the previous step correctly. Some steps are hard to explain and some parts have names that are hard to remember so looking at the pictures more closely can also help you to better understand what needs to be done. Reading is encouraged if you‚Äôd like more detail on where to locate the part, what function it serves on the machine, and other elaborative information.</li>
  <li><b>Remember the language</b>
This manual contains some technical language as well as a distinct visual language. Keeping these in mind will make the assembly easier for you to understand and ensure that less mistakes happen.</li>
</ol>
