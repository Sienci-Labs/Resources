Re-frame page https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-workholding/ to be in the context of the general types of project the person is wanting to do, then recommending workholding based on those project styles e.g. sign-cutting, metal, 3D carves, cookie surfacing.

- Revise page to include all up-to-date Workholding options and the ones we recommend for different project styles / materials
- Explain where each method excels and what situations or materials they simply can‚Äôt handle
- Give examples of where to buy each type (both specific and generic)
- Also include other considerations when making a wasteboard like tiling needing space to pass material through, flip milling needing reference surfaces when flipping, end grain cutting needing space at the end of the table to clamp wood with
- New research on more information we can include https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PDLbZyhQaEzvSSDIwUEN9I4QXlXSRr85oOOaqGCHA1o/edit#heading=h.jjkoazaklfhv
- Make sure if you use screws in mdf you flatten the screw bumps afterwards
- Mostly painless process using hot glue, surfacing with gSender tool, running file, then using rubbing alcohol to solidify the hot glue to remove it though it still wasn't easy by any stretch and couldn't remove all the adhesive

Another aspect of learning how to use your CNC router involves knowing how to properly secure material down to the bed of the machine. Rigidly securing material to the machine bed is crucial when setting up to cut. Some clamping methods are rigid but are more intrusive, while others keep a low profile but aren't quite as strong. Play around with these methods to see which ones you can use individually or in combination for your ideal setup.

If you‚Äôre just starting out with building your machine and are unsure of the types of workholding/clamping setups you might need, it can be daunting making the first decision for how you‚Äôd like to set up your table/wasteboard. We‚Äôll go through each of the common types of table/wasteboard setups below.

| **Tape/Glue**         | - Any type of cutting operation.<br>- Cutting out parts without the need for tabs.<br>- Cutting tall, narrow parts. | - Projects requiring heavy-duty clamping.<br>- Materials with uneven surfaces that tape cannot adhere to. | - None needed                                       |
| **Vise**              | - Cutting very hard materials such as aluminum.<br>- Cutting out many identical parts with quick clamping. | - Cutting thin sheets of material.<br>- Clamping delicate or irregularly shaped materials. | - Vise mounted to wasteboard                       |

### Double-Sided Tape and Adhesive Strips

Double-sided tape and adhesive strips are excellent for lightweight materials such as wood, acrylic, MDF, and small or thin pieces. These methods are non-invasive, meaning they won‚Äôt leave marks or require holes in your material. They allow for tight, flat placement, which is ideal for smooth surfaces and detailed work.

However, double-sided tape is not recommended for heavier materials or projects requiring strong cutting forces, as the adhesive may fail under significant pressure. Additionally, adhesive residue may require cleanup before finishing your project.

**Where to Buy:**  
- Nitto Tape on Amazon  
- 3M VHB Tape

### Clamps

Clamps are versatile and come in various types, including cam clamps, step clamps, and hold-down clamps. They are suitable for general woodworking, sign-making, and soft metal projects, providing a secure hold for materials of different sizes. Their adjustable nature makes them reusable and adaptable for various setups.

However, clamps may interfere with cutter paths if not positioned correctly and can damage softer materials unless padded. Attention to clearance and material protection is crucial when using clamps.

**Where to Buy:**  
- Available at hardware stores, online marketplaces like Amazon, and specialized woodworking suppliers.

### T-Tracks

T-tracks allow you to insert a variety of clamps along their length, such as toe clamps, making it a very quick and versatile way to secure items to your bed. You can find aluminum t-track and compatible clamps online, <a href="https://sienci.com/product/t-track/">on our store</a>, and at your local woodworking store.

**Tips:**

- Putting t-track in then putting thicker MDF slats in between like in the photo allows you to mill off the surface of the MDF to get a perfectly flat surface relative to your machine. It also enables you to make smaller wasteboard replacements, instead of needing to replace the whole board.
- If you have a thick enough waste bed, you can use your machine to cut the grooves for your t-track. Just cut grooves to fit the width of your t-track.
- We designed a custom t-track system that works with hex-headed 1/4"-20 hardware that you can see in our store here: <a href="https://sienci.com/product/t-track/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sienci.com/product/t-track/</a> and has a setup guide here: <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/assembling-add-ons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing the LongMill T-Track set</a>

### Vacuum Tables

Vacuum tables offer a high-tech solution for securing flat, lightweight materials such as thin sheets of wood, acrylic, and aluminum. They work by creating a suction that holds the material firmly in place, eliminating the need for physical clamps or adhesives. This method is ideal for projects where the material surface needs to remain untouched or where clamps would interfere with cutting paths.

While vacuum tables are highly efficient, they require an investment in additional equipment like a vacuum pump, and their effectiveness diminishes with irregular or porous materials.

**Where to Buy:**  
- CNC-specific equipment suppliers  
- Amazon  

---

### Screws and Fasteners

Using screws or fasteners to secure materials directly to the spoilboard is a straightforward and highly secure method. It‚Äôs particularly effective for heavy or thick materials, such as hardwoods and metals, that require maximum stability during cutting. Screws are simple to use and provide a firm hold against strong cutting forces.

However, this method is invasive, as it requires drilling holes into your material or spoilboard. Careful planning is necessary to avoid damaging your final project or misplacing screws in the cutting path.

**Where to Buy:**  
- Hardware stores  
- Online retailers like Home Depot or Amazon  

---

### Tabs and Bridges

Tabs and bridges are software-based solutions that work in tandem with physical workholding methods. During toolpath design, small tabs of uncut material are left in place to prevent pieces from shifting once they‚Äôre cut free from the main stock. These tabs are easily removed after machining and require minimal cleanup.

This method is highly reliable for projects with intricate designs but requires additional post-processing to remove and sand the tabs.

**Software Tools for Tabs:**  
- VCarve  
- Fusion 360  

---

### Wedges

Wedges are a simple yet effective method for securing materials with uneven surfaces or unusual shapes. They work by pressing the material into a tight fit against fixed stops or clamps. This technique is commonly used for irregularly shaped pieces and can be made using scrap wood, making it a cost-effective solution.

However, wedges are best suited for projects that don‚Äôt require extreme precision, as the method relies heavily on manual adjustments.

**Where to Buy:**  
- Made from scrap materials or purchased as part of a workholding kit.

---

### Tape-and-CA Glue Method

This hybrid approach combines double-sided tape with cyanoacrylate (CA) glue for a strong, temporary hold. You place a layer of painter‚Äôs tape on both the material and the spoilboard, then apply CA glue between the tape layers to secure them together. This method offers the strength of adhesive without leaving residue on your material.

The tape-and-CA glue method is ideal for lightweight to medium-weight materials and precise operations but may require extra setup time. Additionally, it‚Äôs less effective for heavy or porous materials.

**Where to Buy:**  
- CA glue and tape are widely available at hardware stores and online.

## Choosing the Right Workholding Method

Selecting the appropriate workholding technique depends on your project‚Äôs material, weight, and design. Here‚Äôs a quick guide to help you decide:  

- **Lightweight and Thin Materials:** Double-sided tape, tape-and-CA glue, vacuum tables.  
- **General Woodworking:** Clamps, T-track systems, screws.  
- **Irregular Shapes:** Wedges, clamps.  
- **Delicate or Detailed Work:** Tape-and-CA glue, tabs.  
- **Heavy Materials:** Screws, clamps.
