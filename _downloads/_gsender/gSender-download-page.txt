## FAQ

Has this program been around for a while?
It has and we’d recommend you check it out! gSender is built off of the already sturdy code infrastructure of CNCjs, plus after over 5 months of Alpha testing then Closed Beta testing with over 300 people it’s now been out in the wild since May 2021. Since public release, gSender is now trusted by tens of thousands of people – and counting – to easily and reliably run their CNC routers every day. In many cases, the capability of the CNC can be dictated by the limitations of the software; we hope you notice the difference with gSender.


Where do I download gSender? Is it free?
gSender is a free program available to be used for many different CNC routers on the market. To download the latest version, there’s a box above on this page titled “Downloads” which is always kept up-to-date as we continue to release new features and improvements.


How do I know if I have the latest version?
This page will always link to download the latest version of gSender. If you’d like to find a particular version or check if you have the latest, you can find all versions here: https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/gsender/releases


What CNC machines can gSender control? Mach3/4? FluidNC?
As long as your CNC is GRBL-based (grbl, grblHAL) and has a minimum of the GRBL 1.1 Firmware then you’ll be able to control it with gSender. gSender can perform easy control of 3-axis machines and also has Rotary and 4th axis functionality.

Unfortunately when it comes to Mach3/4, any motion controller with that firmware is locked down so that it can only be controlled with the Mach3/4 interface software, so you won’t be able to use gSender. If you had a grbl-based motion controller then gSender would be able to work for you.

For FluidNC, since it’s been built off of grbl there are many elements that should make gSender compatible but we just still haven’t had the time to modify gSender to get it working. Fortunately gSender is a fully open source project, so if you want to fork it to get it working for your setup or want to contribute back then we’d be happy to have you do that!


What are the computer/system requirements to run it?
gSender is built to work on Windows/PC (Windows 10 and up), Mac (El Capitan 10.11 and up), Linux, and even Mini PCs or single board computers like a Raspberry Pi. No matter the computer used, our minimum recommended system requirements would be: 2GB of RAM and a 1280 x 768 screen size


Can gSender be used in inches?
Yes! It’s got a global toggle so that everything can be in either mm or inches. It also accepts mm and inches files.


Do you need an internet connection to run gSender?
Not at all. gSender can be run completely standalone once you’ve downloaded the install file. One feature that won’t work without an internet connection is gSender’s ability to automatically check for updates to keep itself up-to-date, though you can always manually install a newer version on top of the current version yourself.


Does it have all the same features as UGS?
UGS and gSender have far more similarities than they have differences. The good news is that both have all the features needed to suit any typical hobby CNCer, and both are also still constantly receiving updates. Each program has it’s own approach to trying to make the best CNC interface, so we’d recommend trying out gSender if you haven’t already!


Can I design in gSender?
No. gSender is strictly a CNC control software and has no features currently for g-code generation outside of some additional features like it’s surfacing and bed leveling tools. You’ll need to use gSender in combination with some other CAM, or design + CAM, software to create your full CNC toolchain.
