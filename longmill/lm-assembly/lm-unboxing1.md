You're finally going to be putting your LongMill together! We hope that you're excited to start making new and interesting things as this CNC router becomes yet another tool you can reach for on your tool-belt.

The LongMill Benchtop CNC is a machine design that we're very proud of: a good balance between performance and affordability, simplicity and rigidity. As more LongMills continue to ship around the globe from our office, we're always keen to hear customer feedback since it helps us to make our benchtop CNC even better. This is why after shipping over 2500 LongMills since it's conception, we've still further introduced some small quality of life updates to the design of the LongMill; newly designated 'Version 4b'.

## Versions

Implementing these improvements batch-by-batch means that there are small variations in the assembly process depending on when you receive your LongMill:

<ul>
<li><b>Version 1</b>: shipped from October 2019 to March 2020</li>
<li><b>Version 2</b>: shipped from March 2020 to August 14th, 2020</li>
<li><b>Version 3</b>: shipped from August 14th, 2020 to January 11th, 2021</li>
<li><b>Version 4</b>: shipped from January 11th, 2021 to August 2nd, 2021</li>
<li><b>Version 4b:</b> current version*</li>
</ul>

<b><em>*Version 4b has a slightly different set of hardware for assembly compared to previous versions. Kits that have this change will have a sticker on their hardware bag to indicate "Batch 5." Revisions will be noted in the online and PDF assembly instructions as you put your machine together.</em></b>

This section of the Resources will always have the assembly instructions for our most recent LongMill version, but a PDF form of both the current version and all previous versions can also be downloaded below if needed:

There is also an impromptu, follow-along, assembly video series available for the LongMill Version 2 that Chris put together if you'd prefer to assemble your machine while following along with a video rather than reading the instructions. The video series also works for Version 3. <b>For Versions 4 and later, there will be minor changes that are not included in the videos, please refer to the PDF or online assembly instructions for clarification.</b>

<b><a href="https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=QwQX3Qb8UUQ&list=PLE43LQy2a1ipOEoEcIGo3cVOw31-iMvPQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LongMill V2 Assembly Video Series</a></b>

## Tooling up

Here is a list of tools you should have on hand for assembly. Most people will have these tools in their shop:
<ul>
<li>Metric Allen keys or a drill and Allen driver bits</li>
<li>A small flat head screwdriver</li>
<li>Rubber mallet (optional)</li>
</ul>

We designed the assembly instructions in a way that you unpack the machine as you go; this helps you to become more familiar with the parts that make up your LongMill. If at any point you're having difficulty finding a part, you can always come back to this page or refer to the Appendices of the PDF manual to see the packing layout of your machine. If you are missing parts or need technical help, please contact us here: <a href="https://sienci.com/contact-us/technical-help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sienci.com/contact-us/technical-help/</a>

Use the bottom buttons to navigate step-by-step or use the sidebar to quickly travel to a desired page. Remember to stay safe during assembly and while being around your machine so that you can enjoy it while getting the most out of it.
