What type of files do I need?

For 2D work, .svg files are good. Try to stay away from .dxf if you can. Much depends on the source of the files, too. Quality can be sketchy from some vendors. For 2.5D and 3D work, .stl files are a sort of standard in “store bought” files. Again, quality will depend on the vendor.

In terms of CAD/CAM applications, Vectric products are a good bet, IMHO. Also, IMHO, getting VCarve Desktop for an AltMill would not be a good choice. Why buy a 4 x 4 machine, then buy software that limits you to a 25 x 25 material size? You can always tile them, but . . . Down the road, you may decide that you want to create your own 3D models. In Vectric products, this will require Aspire. Pricey. The good part of starting out with VCarvePro is that, if you decide to upscale to Aspire, you get full credit for the purchase price of VCarvePro.
