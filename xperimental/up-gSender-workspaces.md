Usually you would only have one origin or zero position for your project, therefore gSender will only save one zero. However, if you plan to do a series of projects that require different zero positions, or are lining up to do some more complex jigging or part batches, you may want to set up multiple workspaces all at once. This can save you time by not having to set a zero position for repetitive tasks or specific jig setups. You can do this by creating up to six different zero positions with the six workspaces in gSender. Access each 'Workspace' at the top right of the program by pressing the drop down to select which workspace to use. gSender will act completely in-line with whatever workspace you've selected, whether you want to set zero, probe, surface, or anything else.
