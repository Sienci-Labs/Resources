Anti-backlash nuts are used on the LongMill to both reduce backlash on the lead screws and to compensate for wear over time. These spring-loaded nuts are a novel design by Sienci Labs which bring traditional anti-backlash nuts to the next level by introducing auto-tensioning. This means you won't need the manually tension these nuts or adjust them over time, as they will take care of this on their own. You can read more about this in <a href="https://sienci.com/2024/02/02/the-saga-of-the-spring-loaded-anti-backlash-nuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our blog post about them</a>.

Upgrading to the new nuts is fairly simple, the only hardware you need is the new nuts while all other hardware is reused. Follow the instructions below or watch the video if it helps.

## Y-Axes

The fastest way to follow these steps will be to have easy access to all sides of your machine and have your machine turned on so you can jog it around. Once you swap out the first nut, you'll find that swapping out the other 3 axes is very similar:

1. Move the Y-axis close to the back of the machine.

1. With your Allen key, remove the two M5 mounting screws from the backlash nuts on the Y-axis plates on both sides. Once they're removed, you should be able to move the Y-axis away from the motor and expose the backlash nut underneath.

1. On the motor coupler, loosen the screw on the lead screw side. Do this until you can slide the lead screw out through the bearing.

1. Rotate the lead screw till the backlash nut is off.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash5.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Thread the new backlash nut onto the lead screw, with the spring side facing the motor.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash6.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Install the two nylon lock nuts into the spring-loaded backlash nut and apply a piece of tape to hold them in place during installation. The dome of the nut should be facing out.

1. Put the lead screw back into the motor coupler and tighten. Repeat steps 3 - 7 for the right Y axis now.

1. Move the gantry over the backlash nut and reinstall the mounting screws, tighten till the split washer is compressed, but be careful not to over tighten. Repeat this step for the right side of the Y-axis.

## X-Axis

Move your X-Axis all the way to the left side to begin the same process we used on the Y-Axis.

**Note that if you have a 30x48, you will need to use a T12 nut instead of a T8 nut, as the lead screw is larger.**

1. Remove the mounting screws from the backlash nuts and move the gantry to expose the backlash nut.

1. Loosen the screw on the motor coupler for the lead screw side and slide the lead screw out from the motor.

1. Rotate the lead screw till the backlash nut is off.

1. Thread the backlash nut onto the lead screw, with the spring side facing to the right (Indicated with the blue arrow).

1. Install the two nylon lock nuts into the spring-loaded backlash nut and apply a piece of tape to hold them in place during installation. The dome of the nut should be facing out. Then put the lead screw back into the motor coupler and tighten.

1. Move the gantry over the backlash nut and reinstall the mounting screws, tighten till the split washer is compressed, but be careful not to over tighten.

## Z-Axis

The Z-axis nut is easier to remove because we donâ€™t have to remove the lead screw from the motor on the MK2 (You will have to do this with the MK1 however).

1. Position the gantry in the middle of the X axis. The backlash nut should be about halfway up the lead screw. Remove the two bolts holding the anti-backlash nut.

1. Once the bolts are removed, the router mount can be lowered out of the way.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash19.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Remove the two screws that hold the router mounting plate onto the gantry. If you have limit switches installed, remove the Z axis one now.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash17.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. This will allow you to tip the motor and lead screw backwards.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash15.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Twist the old anti-backlash nut off the bottom of the lead screw and replace it with the new one, springs facing down. Spin it to the centre of the lead screw.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash16.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Use masking tape to hold the nuts on the back of the new spring-loaded anti-backlash nut and ensure that the dome side of the nuts are facing out. Thread the new backlash nut onto the lead screw, **with the spring side facing down**.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash12.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Reinsert the two bolts to hold the router mounting plate onto the gantry.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash14.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Reinstall the limit switch, ensuring that the washer is flat on the top/bottom to give maximum space for your Z axis to travel.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_loaded_antibacklash13.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Move the router mount up to reinstall the 2 mounting screws into the backlash nuts. Don't over-tighten. Like before, the 2 screws should be tightened till the split washers are compressed.
