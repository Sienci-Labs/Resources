## Spring-loaded Nuts

### X & Y axes

We are going to be removing the old anti-backlash nuts from the X axis, and both Y axes, so they can be replaced with the new spring-loaded versions.

Move the Y axis all the way to the back of the machine, to be closer to the back left motor.

Remove the mounting screws from the backlash nuts and move the gantry to expose the backlash nut.

Loosen the screw on the motor coupler for the leadscrew side and slide the lead screw out from the motor.

Rotate the lead screw till the backlash nut is off.

Thread the backlash nut onto the lead screw, with the spring side facing the motor.

Install the two nylon lock nuts into the spring-loaded backlash nut and apply a piece of tape to hold them in place during installation. The dome of the nut should be facing out.

Put the leadscrew back into the motor coupler and tighten.

Move the gantry over the backlash nut and reinstall the mounting screws, tighten till the split washer is compressed, but be careful not to over tighten.

### Z Axis

The Z-axis nut is easier to remove because we donâ€™t have to remove the leadscrew from the motor on the MK2 (You will have to do this with the MK1 however).

Position the gantry in the middle of the X axis. The backlash nut should be about halfway up the leadscrew. Remove the two bolts holding the anti-backlash nut.

Once the bolts are removed, the router mount can be lowered out of the way.

Remove the two screws that hold the router mounting plate onto the gantry. If you have limit switches installed, remove the Z axis one now.

This will allow you to tip the motor and lead screw backwards.

Twist the old anti-backlash nut off the bottom of the leadscrew and replace it with the new one, springs facing down. Spin it to the centre of the leadscrew.

Use masking tape to hold the nuts on the back of the new spring-loaded anti-backlash nut and ensure that the dome side of the nuts are facing out.

Reinsert the two bolts to hold the router mounting plate onto the gantry.

Reinstall the limit switch, ensuring that the washer is flat on the top/bottom to give maximum space for your Z axis to travel.

Move the router mount up to reinstall the 2 mounting screws into the backlash nuts. Don't over-tighten. Like before, the 2 screws should be tightened till the split washers are compressed.
