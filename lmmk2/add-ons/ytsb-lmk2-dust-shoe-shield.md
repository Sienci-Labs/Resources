## Sienci Labs Dust Shoe

To make dust collection easier for your LongMill, we spent the time to design it its very own dust shoe. <a href="https://sienci.com/product/LongMill-magnetic-dust-shoe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The new Sienci Labs Magnetic Dust Shoe</a> is a great add-on for your machine that can keep dust management easy! This dust shoe is designed specifically for the LongMill and works with 1.5″, and 2″ to 2-1/8″ hoses.

This dust shoe is a Z-axis independent style dust shoe designed to collect dust and debris efficiently.
