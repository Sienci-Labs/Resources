## Installing the LongMill T-Track Set

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QVgtnZMDw

Here is a simple T-track set up that you can mount onto your work table. This is simply a basic guideline on setting up your t-tracks, but feel free to lay them out in whatever way works best for you!

This layout minimizes reductions in cutting area and depth, and can be prepared in advance before your machine arrives. It uses a 48”x48”x ¾” MDF sheet, which can be purchased and cut to size at home or at your local hardware store.

<ol>
<li>Cut a 48” x 48” x ¾” MDF sheet into five pieces of 6” wide planks, and two pieces of 5 ½ ” wide planks.</li>
<li>Lay out the T-tracks and planks on the table, and fasten them down with wood screws. The machine will sit on top of the 5 ½” planks, as the 6” planks are arranged between them. They should be fastened with screws at least 1” in length. Leave about 1” of space between the screws and the ends of the MDF planks.</li>
<li>To ensure your planks are flat against your table, drill counterbore holes in the middle of the 5 ½” planks. You can use the LongMill or a counterboring bit to create the holes, making sure you have removed enough material to recess the screw heads and surface the MDF planks at least 1mm deep. Then fasten them down with wood screws.</li>
<li>Complete the rest of the Table Mounting process as described in the LongMill Resources page: <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lm-table-mounting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://resources.sienci.com/view/lm-table-mounting/</a></li>
<li>Surface the MDF planks, as described in the LongMill Resources page: <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lm-surfacing-wasteboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://resources.sienci.com/view/lm-surfacing-wasteboard/</a></li>
<li>Mount your clamps onto your newly installed T-track table, and enjoy!</li>
</ol>

## Assembling and Using the LongMill T-Clamps

![](/_images/_longmill/_assembly/_addons/lm_addons_p19.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

T-clamps are simple yet reliable workholding tools which are used with T-tracks tables. We’ve come up with T-clamps that work for various metals, plastics and woods, holding down materials from 0.1" to 1” thick. These clamps are ideal for holding down small to medium sized pieces of material. Inside the package:

<ul>
<li>x6 steel clamps</li>
<li>x6 knobs with inserts</li>
<li>x6 3D printed end caps</li>
<li>x12 hex head machine screws</li>
<li>x6 flat washers</li>
<li>x6 T-track rails</li>
<li>100 pcs wood screws</li>
</ul>

How to Assemble T-Clamps:

<ol>
<li>Push the plastic end cap onto the steel clamp - the end with two holes. It should have a slight wiggle but should be not easy to remove.</li>
<li>Fasten a hex bolt onto the other end of the clamp. We recommend the hex head to be facing upwards so that it easily slides into the T-tracks, but you can change it if desired.</li>
<li>Slide the other hex bolt through the clamp slot, with the hex head facing down. Bring the washer and knob from the top, so that the washer is contained between the clamp body and knob.</li>
<li>Now you can slide the downward facing hex bolt onto the t-track and locate the clamp for mounting material</li>
</ol>

How to Use T-Clamps on T-Track Table:

<ol>
<li>Slide the hex bolt head through the T-track, so that the entire clamp is on the table.  You may need to adjust the bolt and knob to have it fit onto the table.</li>
<li>Place your workpiece onto the table.</li>
<li>Move and adjust the clamp to push down onto the workpiece, ensuring that the end cap side of the clamp is lower than the bolt end. Tighten both bolts until snug. Position the clamps so that there is enough space for your cutting job on your workpiece.</li>
<li>Push your material to check if it is secured onto the table. If not, use more T-clamps or other workholding methods.</li>
</ol>
