Anti-backlash nuts are used on the LongMill to both reduce backlash on the lead screws and to compensate for wear over time. These spring-loaded nuts are a novel design by Sienci Labs which bring traditional anti-backlash nuts to the next level by introducing auto-tensioning. This means you won't need the manually tension these nuts or adjust them over time, as they will take care of this on their own. You can read more about this in <a href="https://sienci.com/2024/02/02/the-saga-of-the-spring-loaded-anti-backlash-nuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our blog post about them</a>.

[T8 Spring Loaded Anti-Backlash Nuts](https://sienci.com/product/t8-spring-loaded-anti-backlash-nut/) (4 each) are compatible with LongMill MK1 & MK2 machines of all sizes on the Y and Z axis. The T8 size also works on the X axis of 12X30 and 30X30 machines.

**Note - You will need to purchase a [T12 Spring Loaded Anti Backlash Nut](https://sienci.com/product/t12-spring-loaded-anti-backlash-nut-1pc/) (1 each) for the X axis on your 30X48, as the lead screw is a larger size.**

Upgrading to the new nuts is fairly simple, the only hardware you need is the Allen key used to assemble your machine. We are replacing 4 nuts, one on each side gantry (Y axis) and two in the 'middle gantry' (X & Z axis).

The fastest way to follow these steps will be to have easy access to all sides of your machine and have your machine turned on so you can jog it around. Once you swap out the first nut, you'll find that swapping out the other 3 axes is very similar!

Follow the instructions below or watch the video:

## T8 Y-Axes

1. We want to begin at the back left corner of your machine workspace, closer to the motors, so move the Y-axis close to the **back** of the machine.

1. With your Allen key, remove the two M5 mounting screws from the backlash nuts on the Y-axis plates on both the right and left sides. Once they're removed, you should be able to move the Y-axis **forward** towards the front of the workspace again, away from the motor and expose the backlash nuts underneath.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_3.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Ok! Now we want to remove the lead screw so we can take the old nut off. We will have to disconnect the lead screw from the motor, which is done at the coupler. We only need to loosen the screw on the lead screw side. Do this until you can slide the lead screw out through the bearing completely.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_4.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Rotate the lead screw till the old backlash nut is off, or rotate the nut itself.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_5.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Grab a new T8 spring loaded nut and thread it onto the lead screw, with the spring side facing the motor or back.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_6.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Install the two nylon lock nuts into the spring-loaded backlash nut and apply a piece of tape to hold them in place during installation. The dome of the nut should be facing out.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_7.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Put the lead screw back into the motor coupler and tighten the screw back down. Repeat steps 3 - 7 for the right Y axis now, if you haven't been mirroring the steps as you went along.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_8.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Great job! Now we can move the gantry to the back again, over the new backlash nuts and reinstall the mounting screws, tighten till the split washer is compressed, but be careful not to over tighten. Repeat this step for the right side of the Y-axis.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_yaxis_10.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

You can now remove the tape and take pride in knowing you are 1/2 way through this upgrade already!

## T8 or T12 X-Axis

Just like with the Y axis, we want to be close to the motor to remove the lead screw, so move your X-Axis all the way to the left side to begin the same process we just completed on the Y-Axis.

**Note that if you have a 30x48, you will need to use a T12 nut instead of a T8 nut, as the lead screw is larger.**

1. With the gantry moved to the left side, remove the mounting screws from the backlash nut and move the gantry to the right to expose the old backlash nut.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_xaxis_1.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_xaxis_2.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Now we can loosen the screw on the motor coupler for the lead screw side and slide the lead screw out from the coupler and pull it through the bearing, just like with the Y axis.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_xaxis_3.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Rotate the lead screw till the old backlash nut is off, or twist the nut itself to remove.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_xaxis_4.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Thread the new spring loaded backlash nut onto the lead screw, with the spring side facing **to the right** (Indicated with the blue arrow, this is the reverse of all other axis, because you may lose some cutting area if we put the springs to the wrong side.) Once again install the two nylon lock nuts into the new spring-loaded backlash nut and apply a piece of tape to hold them in place during installation. Remember that the dome of the nut should be facing out.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_xaxis_5.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Now put the lead screw back into the motor coupler and tighten the screw back down.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_xaxis_6.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Move the gantry over the backlash nut and reinstall the mounting screws. Tighten till the split washer is compressed, but be careful not to over tighten.

Three down and one to go! Let's move on to the Z axis.

## T8 Z-Axis

The Z-axis nut is easier to remove because we donâ€™t have to remove the lead screw from the motor on the MK2 (You will have to do this with the MK1 however).

1. Position the gantry in the middle of the X axis. The backlash nut should be about halfway up the lead screw. Remove the two bolts holding the anti-backlash nut.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_1.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Once the bolts are removed, the router mount can be lowered out of the way.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_2.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Remove the two screws that hold the router mounting plate onto the gantry. If you have limit switches installed, remove the Z axis one now.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_3.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. This will allow you to tip the motor and lead screw backwards.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_4.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Twist the old anti-backlash nut off the bottom of the lead screw.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_5.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Use masking tape to hold the nuts on the back of the new spring-loaded anti-backlash nut and ensure that the dome side of the nuts are facing out. Thread the new backlash nut onto the lead screw, **with the spring side facing down**, as indicated with the blue arrow. Spin it to the centre of the lead screw.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_6.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Reinsert the two bolts to hold the router mounting plate onto the gantry and tighten them fully.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_7.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Reinstall the limit switch, ensuring that the washer is flat on the top/bottom to give maximum space for your Z axis to travel.
![](/_images/_lmmk2/_addons/lmk2_spring_zaxis_8.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}
1. Move the router mount back up to align with the new spring loaded nut and reinstall the 2 mounting screws. Don't over-tighten. Like before, the 2 screws should be tightened till the split washers are compressed.

## Conclusion

Congrats! All of the hard work is complete. You have upgraded your machine and won't have to manually adjust these like the old version.

## Troubleshooting

If a T8 or T12 spring-loaded backlash nut is binding, we recommend lubricating the lead screw with a light coating of WD-40 or a similar lubricant. Then run the gantry back and forth along the lead screw to break it in.

Jog on normal speed, increasing to rapid after a few passes. If the nut binds on rapid, reduce the speed to normal and re-run a few more passes.

Wipe the lead screw after to prevent buildup of dust on the lead screws.
