<p style="margin-bottom: -20px;">Hello and welcome to your â¤¦</p>

## LongMill MK2 Resources

This is an area that we've spent years writing, photographing, and tweaking to make it the easiest and most all-encompassing area to learn about all things LongMill and hobby CNC.

Find pages dedicated to:

- basic CNC concepts
- selecting your **software**
- **assembling** your machine and add-ons
- making your **first cuts**
- guidance on **best practices**
- sources for projects and **project inspiration**
- Troubleshooting and maintenance

You'll want to bookmark ðŸ”– this page for all your future use. Think of it like a paper manual you might normally receive when you buy tools - except online. Though learning to use a CNC router isn't a cakewalk, we're not here to sell you a machine and leave you to the sharks. We want to ensure we're doing everything we can to stock your quiver with the knowledge you need to take you all the way through your hobby CNC journey ðŸ™‚

## Navigation

You may already want to jump to a common page such as:

<table class="community-table" style="height: 50px; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; padding: 5px !important; border: none !important;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px; border: none;">[su_button url="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-software-explained/" style="flat" size="8" radius="3" background="var(--sl-blue)" color="#FFFFFF" center="yes"]ðŸ’» Software[/su_button]</td>
<td style="text-align: center; padding: 5px; border: none;">[su_button url="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lm-unboxing/" style="flat" size="8" radius="3" background="var(--sl-blue)" color="#FFFFFF" center="yes"]ðŸ”§ Assembly[/su_button]</td>

if you have yet to choose your CNC design software, are looking to begin assembling your machine, or want to quickly jump to your condensed CNC Handbook.

If you're not in a rush, take a moment to understand how to navigate through your online manual. Understanding how to navigate these pages will ensure you can find the information you're looking for in the future:

1. The MK2 Resources is divided into sections like chapters in a book. Open and scroll through these and click on pages you want to read, these will always be available on the left side of the screen. Read 'The Basics' or 'Software' to become informed about CNC, 'Assembly' or 'Add-ons' to assemble your machine, and reference 'Handbook' for all your day-to-day information on using, learning with, and maintaining your machine
1. Searching particular words will find pages containing those words, speeding up the process of finding the right page
1. The 'Page Contents' acts as a way to quickly scroll along the page you're on to any section of that page. On smaller screens this will appear at the top rather than the right side
1. Any page can be saved or 'printed' if you'd like to reference them offline

Lastly, each page will have buttons at the bottom to move on to the next or previous page. This is handy because it allows you to "flip the page" in the chapter you're reading, allowing you to go step-by-step learning information or navigating assembly.
