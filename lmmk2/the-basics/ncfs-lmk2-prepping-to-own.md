### **Space Requirements**

Setting up your CNC woodworking area requires careful planning, as you'll quickly find you can use more space than just for the machine itself. Know that you can start off with a simple CNC machine on a table, some simple hand tools and still have success.

Let's check out a cramped single car garage shop and explore some things to consider:

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_prep_shop_pic2.jpg "Note the two blue arrows indicating this shop has installed a separate power line on the ceiling"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

1. **Wood Storage**<br>
  Youâ€™ll need a space to store wood materials, whether itâ€™s sheets of plywood, hardwoods, or other materials. Itâ€™s a good idea to designate a dry, organized area to prevent wood warping or damage and to ensure easy access during projects. *Keep out spiders!*

2. **Tools**<br>
  Over time, youâ€™ll accumulate a variety of hand tools, sandpaper, clamps, and accessories. Make sure you have proper storage for these tools near your CNC machine to ensure quick access. Having access to a power bar is also very handy.

3. **Bits**<br>
  Having the original containers for bit or a small shelf or storage bin will help avoid misplacing or damaging small, delicate items like your cutting tools. The shop pictured above has carpet down to prevent any dropped bits from breaking too.

4. **Table**<br>
  Your CNC machine will need a sturdy, flat table or workbench to rest on. You may want to plan for extra space on the left side of your table to allow you to mount the controller or E-stop button.
  
5. **Dust Collection**<br>
  CNC projects generate a lot of dust, so a proper dust collection system is essential. This could be a small vacuum setup like pictured above, or a dedicated wall mounted dust collector to keep your workspace clean and prevent damage to your machine and electronics, like pictured below.

### Power Requirements

When setting up your shop, itâ€™s important to consider the power requirements of both the **controller**, the **router** or **spindle** used, and any other tools added. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown:

1. **Controller** ([SuperLongBoard](https://sienci.com/product/slb/))
   - The **SLB** requires a **24V** external power supply with a **10-12A capacity** to run. This adds up to about **2 amps** on a 120V circuit which is relatively low, but combined with a spindle or router and other equipment, itâ€™s still essential to keep an eye on your overall power usage.
1. **Router Power** ([Makita 1.25HP](https://sienci.com/product/makita-rt0701c-1-25-hp-110v-compact-router/))
   - Many hobbyists start with a **router** instead of a spindle. Routers, like the **Makita RT0701C**, draw around **6-7 amps** on 120V circuits. This is much less than a spindle, making routers a good option if youâ€™re working with limited power supply.
1. **Spindle Power**
   - Spindles come in different power levels, which affects how much electricity they use. Common spindles range from **0.8KW** to **2.2KW**.
     - A **1.5KW spindle** running on **120V** usually draws about **12.5 amps**.
     - A **2.2KW spindle** on **120V** can draw up to **18 amps**.
   - For typical 120V circuits (like the ones with **15A breakers** found in many workshops), a **1.5KW spindle** is about the highest you can use without risking a tripped breaker. Larger spindles, like a **2.2KW**, might need a dedicated circuit with a higher amperage or use of a **220V** outlet.

So, if youâ€™re using a **1.5KW spindle** with the SLB on a standard 120V, 15A circuit, youâ€™ll be close to capacity. Adding a dust collection system or other devices might push you over, requiring a separate circuit. Alternatively, if youâ€™re using a **router**, youâ€™ll have more breathing room for other equipment.

Always double-check your circuitâ€™s breaker ratings to avoid overloading your workshopâ€™s electrical setup.

### **Initial Costs**

- **Machine Cost**<br> CNC machines come in a range of prices depending on size, precision, and brand. Hobby-level machines can start around $500â€“$2,000, while more advanced or larger machines can go well beyond $5,000.
- **Additional Costs**<br> Youâ€™ll also need software for designing your projects, which could involve one-time purchases or subscription fees. Accessories like end mills, clamps, dust collection systems, and materials (wood, MDF, etc.) will add to your initial investment.
- **Upgrades**<br> Over time, you may want to upgrade parts, like getting better tooling, a quieter dust collection system or adding additional features (such as an upgraded spindle or a laser engraver).

#### Those extra costs can add up

Every shop is a bit different, and customizing yours to fit your needs is always a fun challenge. It's not uncommon to reshuffle/reorganize your shop after you've had your CNC for a bit and understand where you want things.

In the chart below we explore many of the things you may want to consider adding to your shop, before your end mill starts spinning. Don't fret too much about 'keeping up with the Joneses', you can start slow and build up your extras when you are ready.

## Learning Curve

There are many moving parts when it comes to producing something from your new CNC machine. An interesting intersection of technology and woodworking. You can produce something on your first try, but it may take several months to become comfortable with all of the steps available to you. Know that you will make some mistakes along the way, but embrace them if you can as learning moments. Store that memory away, and prevent it from happening again. Let's explore some of the new skills you will be learning about, acquiring, and eventually mastering. **You got this!**

- **Software Skills**<br> A significant part of CNC woodworking involves learning CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software. Programs like Fusion 360, Easel, or VCarve have varying degrees of complexity, and mastering them takes time.
- **Toolpaths and Settings**<br> Beyond software, understanding toolpaths (how the machine moves), feed rates, spindle speeds, and materials will come into play. These settings directly affect the success of your projects.
- **Patience Required**<br> Expect to spend a good amount of time experimenting and learning through trial and error. Your first few projects may not be perfect, and thatâ€™s completely normal.
- **Learn about Wood**<br> There are a couple things to focus on learning including how to measure wood, where to buy it, and how to store it.

Here are a couple videos that may prove to be interesting at this point. The first is a good overview of the entire CNC process, followed by some simple projects you can begin with. Begin your journey learning about wood, then explore how AI can assist you on the design side of things.

### Failure is Part of the Process

- **Trial and Error**<br> Donâ€™t be discouraged if your first attempts donâ€™t go as planned. Itâ€™s common to break bits, misalign materials, or get unexpected results. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
- **Material Wastage**<br> You will likely waste some material during the learning phase, whether from incorrect settings or accidents. Plan for some losses as you refine your skills.

We all need to laugh at ourselves every now and again, so here is a video about beginner mistakes and some shorts to giggle with. These are those icebergs we are hoping to avoid ourselves. Isn't it nice when people share their mistakes so we can all learn from them?

[/su_table]

### Time Commitment

- **Setup and Testing**<br> Expect a significant amount of time to be spent on project setupâ€”finalizing the design, securing the workpiece, setting up toolpaths, and making sure everything is aligned. Testing new designs or tool setups on scrap materials is often necessary.
- **Project Completion**<br> Projects can take longer than expected, especially if you are refining a design, troubleshooting issues, or making multiple passes on a complicated cut. Patience is key. Often a roughing pass is used first to remove the bulk of material, then a finishing pass comes along and really smooths thing up.

### Community Support

- **Learning from Others**<br> The CNC woodworking community is large and active. Online forums, YouTube tutorials, and CNC groups are invaluable resources for troubleshooting, tips, and inspiration. Youâ€™re not alone in the learning process.
- **Asking for Help**<br> Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions when you get stuck. Most CNC enthusiasts are willing to share their knowledge and help you through challenges.

## Machine Maintenance

- **[Regular Upkeep](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-maintenance/)**<br> CNC machines require regular maintenance to perform optimally. This includes cleaning your rails & wheels, lubricating parts, checking for loose bolts, and inspecting wiring and belts. Some software like gSender will help you track the number of hours you have been running your machine, and recommend specific maintenance be performed.
- **[Replacing Parts](https://sienci.com/product-category/parts/)**<br> Over time, youâ€™ll need to replace things like the cutting tools, which dull with use, or v-wheels, linear bearings, and delrin nuts that wear out. Knowing how to maintain your machine will help avoid costly breakdowns. Just like replacing tires or windshield wipers on your car.
- **[Calibration](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-checks-and-first-moves/#tuning-movement)**<br> Keeping your machine properly calibrated is key for accuracy. Routine checks on squareness, zeroing, and other factors will save you time and material in the long run.

### Final Thought: **Start Small**

Itâ€™s tempting to jump straight into large or complex projects, but starting with simpler tasks will help you build confidence and understand your machine. Set realistic expectations for your first few months, focus on mastering the basics, and steadily work your way up to more advanced projects. Embarking on your CNC journey can be incredibly rewarding, but it requires patience, learning, and ongoing investment. Enjoy the milestones as you learn new skills and upgrade your projects along the way.

**Stay curious, embrace the mistakes as learning opportunities and you may just find your very own gold treasure! May the winds always be at your back.**
