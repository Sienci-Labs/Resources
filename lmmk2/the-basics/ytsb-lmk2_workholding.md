One important thing to learn is how to properly secure material down to the bed of the machine. Rigidly securing material to the machine bed is crucial when setting up to cut, as you don't want anything moving, sliding or crashing during your cut.

Some clamping methods are strong but get in the way, while others keep a low profile but aren't quite as strong. Play around with these methods to see which ones you can use individually or in combination for your ideal setup.

The ultimate goals are to safely hold your piece in place, and help you make more stuff, in less time. Click one of these shortcut buttons if you want to examine what options are available for your table, see workholding options by project or simply see a list of workholding options.

If you‚Äôre just starting out with building your machine and are unsure of the types of workholding/clamping setups you might need, it can be daunting making the first decision for how you‚Äôd like to set up your table/wasteboard. The good news is that it doesn't have to be complicated at all! We‚Äôll go through each of the common types of table/wasteboard setups below.

## Why Workholding Matters

Securing your material properly to the bed of your CNC machine is one of the most important skills you‚Äôll learn. Rigid workholding keeps your stock from moving, sliding, or crashing during a cut ‚Äî protecting your project, your tools, and your machine.  

Some methods are strong but bulky. Others are low profile but less powerful. The best setups often combine multiple methods to balance strength, clearance, and speed. The ultimate goals:  

- Hold your workpiece safely and securely  
- Make more projects in less time  
- Avoid damage to your material or machine

### Screws

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_making-dust-shoes-1024x768-1.jpg "Here we have secured the material and the individual parts being cut out. No tabs being used here."){.aligncenter .size-medium}

If you don‚Äôt mind a few extra holes in your wasteboard, screws can be a simple, no-fuss way to secure your material. Often first time users will stick to this method to learn, and then replace their wasteboard once they get the hang of this new hobby. Just grab some screws and fix your material directly onto the wasteboard. Simple and secure for large or heavy stock. Plan placement to avoid tool collisions, and add extra screws if you are cutting out pieces. Check out [Tabs](#tabs--bridges) if you don't want to have a screw go through your cutout piece.

#### Screw Gotchas

| Issue | Description | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Raised Areas** üîÑ | Screws can tear out wasteboard material, leaving bumps that interfere with future projects. | Scrape flat with a paint scraper or surface the wasteboard. |
| **Splitting Material** üìè | Driving screws directly into your project can split wood, especially near edges. | Pre-drill holes to prevent splitting. |
| **Screw Length Matters** üò± | Screws that are too long can punch through the table or damage the machine. | Use screws short enough to stay within the wasteboard. |
| **Bowed Material** üìê | Large sheets only screwed at the corners may bow upward in the center, causing uneven cuts. | Add screws or clamps across the middle to keep material flat. |
| **Router Bit Collision** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Hitting a screw with the router bit can break the bit, damage the spindle, and ruin the project. | Plan screw placement carefully, keep them clear of toolpaths, and double-check in CAM. |
| **Stripped Screw Heads** üîß | Screws can strip easily if reused or overtightened, making removal difficult. | Use good quality screws, avoid over-tightening, and keep a screw extractor handy. |
| **Wasteboard Wear** ü™µ | Repeated screwing into the same spots weakens the wasteboard and reduces holding power. | Rotate screw locations or replace/resurface your wasteboard periodically. |
| **Metal-to-Metal Contact** ‚ö° | Driving screws into hidden T-tracks, threaded inserts, or hardware under the wasteboard can cause damage. | Know your wasteboard layout and avoid those areas. |
| **Vibration Loosening** üî© | Cutting vibrations can slowly back screws out, loosening the hold. | Re-check screws before long jobs and use coarse-thread screws for MDF. |
| **Limited Repositioning** üö´ | Once material is screwed down, it‚Äôs harder to adjust alignment or squareness. | Double-check placement before tightening all screws. |

While this method is quick and easy, it does mean your wasteboard will get a bit of wear and tear over time. But if that doesn‚Äôt bother you, it‚Äôs a solid, cheap and easy option!

[tabby title="Tape & Glue"]

### Tape & CA Glue or Double Sided Tape

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_IMG_8633.JPG){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Painter‚Äôs tape on both surfaces with CA glue in between. Strong, temporary hold that leaves no residue on your material.

#### Tape Gotchas

| Issue | Description | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Surface Prep Matters** üßΩ | Dust, oil, or uneven surfaces weaken the bond, causing parts to shift mid-cut. | Clean both surfaces and use painter‚Äôs tape or sand lightly before applying. |
| **Difficult Removal** ü™õ | Strong adhesives can tear fibers from wood or leave sticky residue. | Use a heat gun, scraper, or adhesive remover to release cleanly. |
| **Material Thickness** üìè | Thin or flexible parts may bow or warp if tape is the only hold. | Add extra tape coverage or use auxiliary clamping. |
| **Heavy Cuts** ‚ö° | Aggressive passes or large bits can overcome tape‚Äôs holding power. | Use lighter passes, smaller step-downs, or combine with clamps. |
| **Residue on Tools** üß¥ | CA glue squeeze-out or tape adhesive can gunk up bits. | Apply minimal glue, keep it centered, and clean tools with acetone if needed. |
| **Temperature Sensitivity** üå°Ô∏è | Adhesives can fail in cold shops or soften in heat, reducing hold strength. | Keep materials at room temp and avoid extreme environments. |
| **Wasteboard Damage** ü™µ | Over-aggressive removal can lift fibers from the wasteboard. | Use painter‚Äôs tape under the CA glue method so only tape peels away. |
| **Alignment Issues** üéØ | Once taped down, parts can be hard to reposition without re-taping. | Dry-fit and mark positions before committing with adhesive. |

[tabby title="T-Tracks"]

### T-tracks/T-slot mounted to the table

T-Tracks are a tried-and-true favorite among hobbyists and pros alike. These handy tracks let you position clamps anywhere along the wasteboard, making it easy to secure odd-shaped materials and quickly rearrange clamps for different-sized projects. You can find aluminum t-track and compatible clamps online, <a href="https://sienci.com/product/t-track/">on our store</a>, and at your local woodworking store.

Check out this great video on building a bench and installing T-tracks [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4QVgtnZMDw)

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_Keiths-ttrack.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### T-Tracks Gotchas

| Issue | Description | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Incorrect Track Placement** üìè | T-tracks that aren‚Äôt perfectly parallel can misalign clamps or material. | Measure carefully and mark lines before installing. |
| **Track Clearance** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Clamps can hit screws, wasteboard edges, or the machine if tracks are too close to the sides. | Plan track layout and ensure sufficient clearance around all clamps. |
| **Loose Hardware** üî© | Bolts or T-nuts can loosen over time with vibration, reducing clamping strength. | Use lock washers, thread locker, or periodically check tightness. |
| **Compatibility Issues** üîß | Some clamps may not fit your track profile or may slide unexpectedly. | Confirm clamp size/type matches your T-track before buying. |
| **Track Obstructions** üõë | Debris or dust in the T-slot can prevent smooth movement of clamps. | Keep T-slots clean and vacuum regularly. |
| **Upfront Cost & Setup** üí≤ | T-tracks require purchasing and mounting, unlike screws or tape. | Invest in proper installation; it‚Äôs a long-term solution. |
| **Cutting Near Tracks** ‚úÇÔ∏è | Cutting too close can damage the track or clamps. | Plan toolpaths to avoid the area directly above the track. |
| **Warped or Uneven Wasteboard** üìê | Clamps may not sit flush if the table surface isn‚Äôt flat. | Surface the wasteboard or use shims under clamps as needed. |

**Tips:**

- Putting t-track in then putting thicker MDF slats in between like in the photo allows you to mill off the surface of the MDF to get a perfectly flat surface relative to your machine. It also enables you to make smaller wasteboard replacements, instead of needing to replace the whole board.
- If you have a thick enough waste bed, you can use your machine to cut the grooves for your t-track. Just cut grooves to fit the width of your t-track.
- We designed a custom t-track system that works with hex-headed 1/4"-20 hardware that you can see in our store here: <a href="https://sienci.com/product/t-track/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sienci.com/product/t-track/</a> and has a setup guide here: <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/assembling-add-ons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing the LongMill T-Track set</a>

T-Tracks work best with top clamps, though some side clamps can also be used. Keep in mind that certain side clamps may have a limited range or might slip when aligned with the track direction.

#### Why Use T-Tracks?

**Super Flexible**: Position clamps anywhere along the track for max versatility. üîß

**Quick Adjustments**: Easily reposition clamps when switching between projects. ‚è≥

**Great for Odd Shapes**: Perfect for securing irregularly shaped materials. üõ†Ô∏è

While T-Tracks require an upfront investment and a bit of setup time, they‚Äôre a reusable, long-term solution that‚Äôll save you time and money compared to one-time-use options like double-sided tape.  If you find yourself working on a variety of projects, this system may be right for you. Check out our community chatting about building a t-track table [Community Link](https://forum.sienci.com/t/t-track-install/2120).

T-tracks are available for purchase on our store page here, or can be found in other sizes/variations from other sources depending on your needs. Full instructions for installing T-tracks can be found [Instructions](https://sienci.com/product/t-track/).

[tabby title="Threaded Inserts"]

### Threaded Inserts

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_threaded.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Threaded inserts are a good budget alternative to t-tracks. These little gems let you secure clamps anywhere on your wasteboard, giving you plenty of flexibility in positioning. You can space them out further apart for general use or pack them closer together for fine-tuned adjustments.

Threaded inserts work well with both top clamps and side clamps. Just be careful when tightening your clamps‚Äîoverdoing it can pull the inserts out.

#### Threaded Inserts Gotchas

| Issue | Description | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Pull-Out Risk** üî© | Over-tightening clamps can pull inserts out of the wasteboard. | Pre-drill proper-sized holes, countersink if needed, and don‚Äôt over-tighten. |
| **Misaligned Inserts** üìè | Inserts not perfectly vertical can tilt clamps and cause uneven pressure. | Use a guide or jig to keep inserts straight during installation. |
| **Wasteboard Damage** ü™µ | Screwing inserts into a weak or thin board can crack or compress the MDF/plywood. | Use thick, stable wasteboards and consider gluing inserts for extra strength. |
| **Spacing Errors** üìê | Inserts too far apart can limit clamp placement or reduce flexibility. | Plan a layout in advance for your typical projects. |
| **Insert Type Mismatch** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Different thread sizes or types may not match your clamps. | Confirm thread size (e.g., 1/4‚Äù-20) and clamp compatibility. |
| **Difficulty Removing Inserts** üîß | Some inserts can get stuck or cross-threaded when removing hardware. | Take care during installation and use proper tools for removal. |
| **Debris in Threads** üßπ | Sawdust or chips can get stuck in insert threads, making clamp installation difficult. | Blow out or clean threads before use. |
| **Time Investment** ‚è≥ | Installing multiple inserts takes more effort than simpler methods like screws or tape. | Install once, then enjoy long-term flexibility. |

#### Why Use Threaded Inserts?

**Affordable & Effective**: A cost-efficient way to add clamping flexibility. üí≤

**Customizable Layout**: Space them how you like for your specific projects. üìè

**Great for Clamping Options**: Works with both top and side clamps. üî©

#### Setting Up Threaded Inserts

To install these, you‚Äôll first need to pre-drill a pattern of 5/16‚Äù (8mm) holes in your wasteboard.

Include a small ¬Ω‚Äù diameter, ¬º‚Äù deep counterbore so that these inserts sit below the top of the wasteboard out of the way for surfacing. Install the inserts securely‚Äîsome types screw in, while others press in.

Threaded inserts can also be used to secure other add-ons like the Vortex shown in the picture below.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_threadedvortex.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Though not as quick to adjust as T-Tracks, threaded inserts are reliable, durable, and won‚Äôt break the bank. A solid choice for any CNC setup!

Threaded inserts are available for purchase in packs of 25 or 100 pcs on our store page [Buy A Pack](https://sienci.com/product/threaded-inserts/). These use a ¬º-20 internal thread to interface with any clamp you might be using.

[tabby title="Clamps"]

### Clamps

Clamps are versatile and come in various types, including CAM clamps, low profile clamps, and hold-down clamps. They are suitable for general woodworking, sign-making, and soft metal projects, providing a secure hold for materials of different sizes. Their adjustable nature makes them reusable and adaptable for various setups.

However, clamps may interfere with cutter paths if not positioned correctly and can damage softer materials unless padded. Attention to clearance and material protection is crucial when using clamps. Let's explore some of the commonly used clamps and their applications.

**Top Hold-Down Clamps**

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_IMG_7676.JPG "Don't be afraid to use a combination of t-tracks and threaded inserts, or mix and match your workholding"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Apply pressure from above ‚Äî ideal for flat workpieces, engraving, and general cutting. Easy to adjust but can interfere with toolpaths if not placed carefully.

**Toe Clamps**

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_clamptoe.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Toe clamps apply pressure from the side, pulling the material down and towards a fixed surface. This makes them perfect for securing materials without obstructing the top surface‚Äîideal for machining tasks requiring full access to the top of the workpiece, like surfacing.

**CAM Clamps**

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_camclamp2.jpg "Source - https://global.toolstoday.com/learn/best-cnc-workholding-methods-for-woodworking"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

CAM clamps use a rotating CAM mechanism to apply quick, strong pressure. They‚Äôre great for projects where you need to clamp and release material frequently. Just a small twist, and you're locked in.

**Low Profile Clamps**

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_lowprofile.jpg "Source - https://www.reddit.com/r/hobbycnc/comments/18s7acz/low_profile_work_holding/"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Low profile clamps keep a low clearance, making them perfect for setups where vertical space is limited. They help avoid interference with cutting tools while still keeping material firmly in place. A great option for precision work.

**Step Clamps**

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_stepclamp2.jpg "Source - https://www.cnccookbook.com/easy-guide-to-cnc-clamps/"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Step clamps have adjustable steps that allow for height variations, making them great for uneven or varying thickness materials. They offer flexibility for holding down irregularly shaped workpieces without excessive force.

**Side Clamps**

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_sideclampmed.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_sideclampsmall.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Pull the material down and inward from the side, keeping the top surface clear. Perfect for surfacing or when cutting across the entire top face.

## Clamp Gotchas

| Issue | Description | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Toolpath Interference** ‚úÇÔ∏è | Clamps can block the router or spindle if placed too close to the cut. | Plan clamp positions outside the toolpath; simulate in CAM software. |
| **Uneven Pressure** ‚öñÔ∏è | Uneven clamping can warp or lift the workpiece. | Tighten clamps evenly and use multiple clamps if needed. |
| **Material Damage** ü™µ | Metal clamps can dent or mar soft materials. | Use padded or soft jaw clamps. |
| **Slipping Clamps** ‚ö†Ô∏è | Clamps can slide along T-tracks or inserts if not tightened properly. | Double-check torque and use locking hardware if available. |
| **Vibration Loosening** üî© | CNC vibrations can loosen clamps during long cuts. | Recheck clamp tightness before starting the job. |
| **Over-tightening** üí™ | Too much pressure can crack or distort the material. | Apply only enough pressure to hold the material securely. |

[tabby title="Vise"]

![Vise](path/to/vise.jpg)

Holds small or irregular parts securely between jaws. Great for metals and repeat jobs; add soft jaws to protect delicate materials.

[tabby title="Dog Holes"]

![Dog Holes](path/to/dog-holes.jpg)

Pre-drilled grid of holes used with bench dogs or stops for repeat positioning. Best in woodworking.

[tabby title="Fence"]

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_fencenclamps.jpg "Here the fences (left & bottom) are used along with a toe clamp (top) and eccentric clamp (right)"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

If you want an easy and reliable way to keep your material in place, a fence is a great option. A fence is simply a straight edge attached to the wasteboard, giving you a solid reference point for aligning your workpieces. It's often added on the bottom left side of your workspace, but can be placed anywhere. It‚Äôs especially handy if you're doing repeat jobs‚Äîno more constant measuring and repositioning. üéØ

There are different ways to add a fence to your setup:

Fixed Fence: Screw it down or use threaded inserts for a permanent, rock-solid setup. Great for projects that require precise, repeatable alignment. üî©

Adjustable Fence: Use T-tracks or clamps to move the fence around when working with different-sized materials. More flexibility, but still keeps things steady!

#### Why Use a Fence?

**Better Accuracy**: Keeps your material square to the machine‚Äôs axes, reducing cutting mistakes. üéØ

**Saves Time**: Speeds up setup time for repeat jobs‚Äîno more fiddling around to get things aligned. ‚è≥

**Prevents Movement**: Helps stop material from shifting when the machine is doing its thing. üöÄ

#### Setting Up a Fence

Pick a straight, sturdy material like aluminum or MDF.

Secure it to the wasteboard using screws, threaded inserts, or clamps. üîß

Align the fence parallel to the X or Y axis so your cuts are precise. üìè

For extra repeatability, add alignment pins or dowel holes. üéØ

A fence works great alongside other hold-down methods like clamps or tape. Just remember, for heavier cuts, you might need some extra securing power!  Keep your projects locked in and running smooth!

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_fencewcutout.jpeg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Fixed or adjustable straight edge for aligning material and repeating setups. Saves time and improves accuracy.

[tabby title="Tabs & Bridges"]

### Tabs & Bridges

Tabs and bridges are software-based solutions that work in tandem with physical workholding methods. During toolpath design, small tabs of uncut material are left in place to prevent pieces from shifting once they‚Äôre cut free from the main stock. These tabs are easily removed after machining and require minimal cleanup.

This method is highly reliable for projects with intricate designs but requires additional post-processing to remove and sand the tabs.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_tabs.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

**Software Tools for Tabs:**  

- VCarve  
- Fusion 360  

![Tabs and Bridges](path/to/tabs-bridges.jpg)

Leave small uncut sections in your design to hold parts in place until the job finishes. Remove and sand afterwards.

[tabby title="Wedges"]

![Wedges](path/to/wedges.jpg)

Press irregular shapes or uneven stock into place against stops. Cheap and simple, but less precise.

[tabby title="Vertical Clamping"]

Most hobby CNC setups focus on flat work, but adding vertical clamping opens a whole new world of possibilities. By cutting a slot in your CNC router bed and mounting a vise underneath  ‚Äîperpendicular to the table‚Äî you can secure boards on edge for precision machining. This setup doesn‚Äôt just let you work the edge of a board; it enables advanced joinery like dovetails, box joints, and even angled variations. It‚Äôs a simple modification that transforms your machine from a flat-surface cutter into a versatile joinery powerhouse.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_vertical3.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

**Best for**: Engraving, side machining, and creating joinery like dovetails on projects.

**Considerations**: Ensure even pressure to prevent material shifting. Using multiple vertical clamps can improve stability. üîß

[tabby title="Vacuum Tables"]

### Vacuum Tables

A vacuum (vac) table is an advanced workholding solution that provides excellent material support while eliminating the need for mechanical clamps. This method is especially useful for securing thin or delicate materials that could be damaged by traditional clamping methods.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_seal-series.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Vac tables work by creating suction that holds the material securely in place. This makes them ideal for projects requiring a completely unobstructed top surface, such as engraving or through-cutting applications.

One of the biggest advantages of a vac table is its speed and ease of use. Since there are no physical clamps to adjust, material changes can be done in seconds. Additionally, vac tables provide even pressure across the entire workpiece, reducing the risk of warping or lifting during cutting.

However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

**Porosity of the material**: Highly porous materials may not hold well unless a dedicated vacuum wasteboard or gasket is used to maintain suction.

**Initial setup cost**: Vac tables require a vacuum pump or blower system, which can be an investment depending on the size and power needed.

**Power consumption and noise**: Vacuum pumps can be noisy and require continuous power to maintain suction, making them less practical for certain environments.

Vac tables are best suited for flat sheet materials like acrylic, MDF, plywood, and aluminum. If you frequently work with these materials and require fast setups with a clean top surface, a vac table can be a worthwhile investment.

Make your own vac table following [THESE](https://www.instructables.com/Vacuum-Table-for-CNC-Router/) instructions!

### Vacuum Tables

Vacuum tables offer a high-tech solution for securing flat, lightweight materials such as thin sheets of wood, acrylic, and aluminum. They work by creating a suction that holds the material firmly in place, eliminating the need for physical clamps or adhesives. This method is ideal for projects where the material surface needs to remain untouched or where clamps would interfere with cutting paths.

While vacuum tables are highly efficient, they require an investment in additional equipment like a vacuum pump, and their effectiveness diminishes with irregular or porous materials.

**Where to Buy:**  

- CNC-specific equipment suppliers  
- Amazon

### Screws and Fasteners

Using screws or fasteners to secure materials directly to the wasteboard is a straightforward and highly secure method. It‚Äôs particularly effective for heavy or thick materials, such as hardwoods and metals, that require maximum stability during cutting. Screws are simple to use and provide a firm hold against strong cutting forces.

However, this method is invasive, as it requires drilling holes into your material or wasteboard. Careful planning is necessary to avoid damaging your final project or misplacing screws in the cutting path.

**Where to Buy:**  

- Hardware stores  
- Online retailers like Home Depot or Amazon  


### Wedges

Wedges are a simple yet effective method for securing materials with uneven surfaces or unusual shapes. They work by pressing the material into a tight fit against fixed stops or clamps. This technique is commonly used for irregularly shaped pieces and can be made using scrap wood, making it a cost-effective solution.

However, wedges are best suited for projects that don‚Äôt require extreme precision, as the method relies heavily on manual adjustments.

**Where to Buy:**  

- Made from scrap materials or purchased as part of a workholding kit.

### Vice

A vise is a great workholding solution when machining small or irregularly shaped parts. By securely clamping the material between its jaws, a vise prevents movement and ensures precision during cutting.

It works well for metal, wood, and plastic, providing a stable grip without the need for adhesives or screws. For added versatility, soft jaws or custom inserts can be used to protect delicate materials or hold non-standard shapes. When using a vise, ensure it's properly aligned and tightened to avoid shifting, and consider adding parallels to keep the workpiece level for consistent milling.

### Double-Sided Tape, Carpet tape or Adhesive Strips

Double-sided tape and adhesive strips are excellent for lightweight materials such as wood, acrylic, MDF, and small or thin pieces. These methods are non-invasive, meaning they won‚Äôt leave marks or require holes in your material. They allow for tight, flat placement, which is ideal for smooth surfaces and detailed work.

However, double-sided tape is not recommended for heavier materials or projects requiring strong cutting forces, as the adhesive may fail under significant pressure. Additionally, adhesive residue may require cleanup before finishing your project.

**Where to Buy:**  

- Nitto Tape on Amazon  
- 3M VHB Tape  

### Tape-and-CA Glue Method

This hybrid approach combines double-sided tape with cyanoacrylate (CA) glue for a strong, temporary hold. You place a layer of painter‚Äôs tape on both the material and the wasteboard, then apply CA glue between the tape layers to secure them together. This method offers the strength of adhesive without leaving residue on your material.

#### Tips

- Set your zero to the wasteboard and not the top of the material to ensure a consistent cut all the way through
- Medium viscosity CA glue takes a while to dry. Spread it around with a scraper on the tape. Apply sparingly to avoid leaks through the tape

**Where to Buy:**  

- CA glue and tape are widely available at hardware stores and online.
