## Why Workholding Matters

Securing your material properly to the bed of your CNC machine is one of the most important skills you‚Äôll learn. Rigid workholding keeps your stock from moving, sliding, or crashing during a cut ‚Äî protecting your project, your tools, and your machine.  

Some methods are strong but bulky. Others are low profile but less powerful. The best setups often combine multiple methods to balance strength, clearance, and speed. The ultimate goals:  

- Hold your workpiece safely and securely  
- Make more projects in less time  
- Avoid damage to your material or machine

## Building Your Wasteboard/Table Setup

### Screwing Directly into the Wasteboard

- **How it works:** Drive screws through clamps or directly into your stock and wasteboard.  
- **Pros:** Cheap, quick, and beginner-friendly.  
- **Cons:** Leaves holes in your wasteboard, risks splitting material if not pre-drilled.  
- **Tips:**  
  - Pre-drill holes near edges to prevent splitting.  
  - Use screws short enough to avoid hitting the table below.  
  - Scrape raised bumps left by screw tear-out.  

---

### Threaded Inserts

- **How it works:** Install metal inserts in a grid pattern across your wasteboard to create strong, reusable anchor points for clamps.  
- **Pros:** Affordable, flexible positioning, works with both top and side clamps.  
- **Cons:** Slower to reposition compared to T-tracks.  
- **Tips:**  
  - Pre-drill holes and counterbores so inserts sit below the surface.  
  - Avoid overtightening to prevent pulling inserts out.  

---

### T-Tracks

- **How it works:** Aluminum tracks embedded in the table let you slide clamps to any position.  
- **Pros:** Very versatile, quick adjustments, great for odd shapes.  
- **Cons:** Upfront cost and installation time.  
- **Tips:**  
  - Fill gaps between tracks with MDF slats you can surface flat.  
  - Cut grooves with your CNC for a perfect fit.  

---

### Vacuum Tables

- **How it works:** Uses suction to hold materials flat without mechanical clamps.  
- **Best for:** Thin or delicate sheet goods like acrylic, MDF, or plywood.  
- **Cons:** Requires a vacuum pump, may struggle with porous materials, can be noisy.  
- **Pros:** Fast material changes, completely unobstructed cutting surface.  

---

### Vertical Clamping

- **How it works:** Side-mounted clamps hold tall or stacked material upright.  
- **Best for:** Side machining, joinery, and engraving edges.  
- **Tip:** Use multiple clamps for even pressure and stability.

## Common Workholding Methods

### Top Hold-Down Clamps
Apply pressure from above ‚Äî ideal for flat workpieces, engraving, and general cutting. Easy to adjust but can interfere with toolpaths if not placed carefully.

---

### Toe Clamps
Pull the material down and inward from the side, keeping the top surface clear. Perfect for surfacing or when cutting across the entire top face.

---

### Screws
Simple and secure for large or heavy stock. Plan placement to avoid tool collisions.

---

### Tape-and-CA Glue Method
Painter‚Äôs tape on both surfaces with CA glue in between. Strong, temporary hold that leaves no residue on your material.

---

### Double-Sided Tape, Carpet Tape, or Adhesive Strips
Good for light materials and smooth surfaces. Avoid with aggressive cuts; may leave adhesive residue.

---

### Vacuum Tables
High-tech option for holding sheet goods perfectly flat. Ideal for delicate materials, though less effective with porous surfaces.

---

### Vise
Holds small or irregular parts securely between jaws. Great for metals and repeat jobs; add soft jaws to protect delicate materials.

---

### Dog Holes
Pre-drilled grid of holes used with bench dogs or stops for repeat positioning. Best in woodworking.

---

### Fence
Fixed or adjustable straight edge for aligning material and repeating setups. Saves time and improves accuracy.

---

### Tabs and Bridges
Leave small uncut sections in your design to hold parts in place until the job finishes. Remove and sand afterwards.

---

### Wedges
Press irregular shapes or uneven stock into place against stops. Cheap and simple, but less precise.

One important thing to learn is how to properly secure material down to the bed of the machine. Rigidly securing material to the machine bed is crucial when setting up to cut, as you don't want anything moving, sliding or crashing during your cut.

Some clamping methods are strong but get in the way, while others keep a low profile but aren't quite as strong. Play around with these methods to see which ones you can use individually or in combination for your ideal setup.

The ultimate goals are to safely hold your piece in place, and help you make more stuff, in less time. Click one of these shortcut buttons if you want to examine what options are available for your table, see workholding options by project or simply see a list of workholding options.

<h2 id="table-setup">üìê Table Setup</h2>

If you‚Äôre just starting out with building your machine and are unsure of the types of workholding/clamping setups you might need, it can be daunting making the first decision for how you‚Äôd like to set up your table/wasteboard. The good news is that it doesn't have to be complicated at all! We‚Äôll go through each of the common types of table/wasteboard setups below.

### Screwing directly into the wasteboard

If you don‚Äôt mind a few extra holes in your wasteboard, screws can be a simple, no-fuss way to secure your material. Often first time users will stick to this method to learn, and then replace their wasteboard once they get the hang of this new hobby. Just grab some screws and fix your clamps or material directly onto the wasteboard.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_making-dust-shoes-1024x768-1.jpg "Here we have secured the material and the individual parts being cut out. No tabs being used here."){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### Things to Watch Out For

**Raised Areas**: Screws can tear out the wasteboard material, leaving bumps that mess up future projects. A paint scraper can help smooth things out again. üîÑ

**Splitting Material**: If you're screwing through your project into the wasteboard, be sure to pre-drill holes to avoid splitting the material, especially near the edges. üìè

**Screw Length Matters**: Make sure your screws aren‚Äôt too long, or they‚Äôll punch right through the table! üò±

While this method is quick and easy, it does mean your wasteboard will get a bit of wear and tear over time. But if that doesn‚Äôt bother you, it‚Äôs a solid option!

### Threaded inserts in the table

Threaded inserts are a good budget alternative to t-tracks. These little gems let you secure clamps anywhere on your wasteboard, giving you plenty of flexibility in positioning. You can space them out further apart for general use or pack them closer together for fine-tuned adjustments.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_threaded.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Threaded inserts work well with both top clamps and side clamps. Just be careful when tightening your clamps‚Äîoverdoing it can pull the inserts out.

#### Why Use Threaded Inserts?

**Affordable & Effective**: A cost-efficient way to add clamping flexibility. üí≤

**Customizable Layout**: Space them how you like for your specific projects. üìè

**Great for Clamping Options**: Works with both top and side clamps. üî©

#### Setting Up Threaded Inserts

To install these, you‚Äôll first need to pre-drill a pattern of 5/16‚Äù (8mm) holes in your wasteboard.

Include a small ¬Ω‚Äù diameter, ¬º‚Äù deep counterbore so that these inserts sit below the top of the wasteboard out of the way for surfacing. Install the inserts securely‚Äîsome types screw in, while others press in.

Threaded inserts can also be used to secure other add-ons like the Vortex shown in the picture below.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_threadedvortex.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Though not as quick to adjust as T-Tracks, threaded inserts are reliable, durable, and won‚Äôt break the bank. A solid choice for any CNC setup!

Threaded inserts are available for purchase in packs of 25 or 100 pcs on our store page [HERE](https://sienci.com/product/threaded-inserts/). These use a ¬º-20 internal thread to interface with any clamp you might be using.

### T-tracks/T-slot mounted to the table

T-Tracks are a tried-and-true favorite among hobbyists and pros alike. These handy tracks let you position clamps anywhere along the wasteboard, making it easy to secure odd-shaped materials and quickly rearrange clamps for different-sized projects.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_Keiths-ttrack.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

T-Tracks work best with top clamps, though some side clamps can also be used. Keep in mind that certain side clamps may have a limited range or might slip when aligned with the track direction.

#### Why Use T-Tracks?

**Super Flexible**: Position clamps anywhere along the track for max versatility. üîß

**Quick Adjustments**: Easily reposition clamps when switching between projects. ‚è≥

**Great for Odd Shapes**: Perfect for securing irregularly shaped materials. üõ†Ô∏è

While T-Tracks require an upfront investment and a bit of setup time, they‚Äôre a reusable, long-term solution that‚Äôll save you time and money compared to one-time-use options like double-sided tape.  If you find yourself working on a variety of projects, this system may be right for you. Check out our community chatting about building a t-track table [HERE](https://forum.sienci.com/t/t-track-install/2120).

T-tracks are available for purchase on our store page here, or can be found in other sizes/variations from other sources depending on your needs. Full instructions for installing T-tracks can be found [HERE](https://sienci.com/product/t-track/).

### Vac Table

A vacuum (vac) table is an advanced workholding solution that provides excellent material support while eliminating the need for mechanical clamps. This method is especially useful for securing thin or delicate materials that could be damaged by traditional clamping methods.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_seal-series.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Vac tables work by creating suction that holds the material securely in place. This makes them ideal for projects requiring a completely unobstructed top surface, such as engraving or through-cutting applications.

One of the biggest advantages of a vac table is its speed and ease of use. Since there are no physical clamps to adjust, material changes can be done in seconds. Additionally, vac tables provide even pressure across the entire workpiece, reducing the risk of warping or lifting during cutting.

However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

**Porosity of the material**: Highly porous materials may not hold well unless a dedicated vacuum wasteboard or gasket is used to maintain suction.

**Initial setup cost**: Vac tables require a vacuum pump or blower system, which can be an investment depending on the size and power needed.

**Power consumption and noise**: Vacuum pumps can be noisy and require continuous power to maintain suction, making them less practical for certain environments.

Vac tables are best suited for flat sheet materials like acrylic, MDF, plywood, and aluminum. If you frequently work with these materials and require fast setups with a clean top surface, a vac table can be a worthwhile investment.

Make your own vac table following [THESE](https://www.instructables.com/Vacuum-Table-for-CNC-Router/) instructions!

### Vertical Clamping

Vertical clamping is essential when working on taller or stacked materials. These clamps secure your workpiece from the sides, allowing for full access to the top and bottom. Great for precision machining and milling, vertical clamps ensure stability without interfering with toolpaths.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_vertical3.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

**Best for**: Engraving, side machining, and creating joinery like dovetails on projects.

**Considerations**: Ensure even pressure to prevent material shifting. Using multiple vertical clamps can improve stability. üîß

### Clamps

Clamps are versatile and come in various types, including CAM clamps, low profile clamps, and hold-down clamps. They are suitable for general woodworking, sign-making, and soft metal projects, providing a secure hold for materials of different sizes. Their adjustable nature makes them reusable and adaptable for various setups.

However, clamps may interfere with cutter paths if not positioned correctly and can damage softer materials unless padded. Attention to clearance and material protection is crucial when using clamps.

#### Top Hold Down Clamps

Top hold-down clamps secure your material by applying pressure from above. Ideal for flat workpieces, they keep everything in place while allowing for easy adjustments. Great for engraving projects.

#### Toe Clamps

Toe clamps apply pressure from the side, pulling the material down and towards a fixed surface. This makes them perfect for securing materials without obstructing the top surface‚Äîideal for machining tasks requiring full access to the top of the workpiece, like surfacing.

#### Step Clamps

Step clamps have adjustable steps that allow for height variations, making them great for uneven or varying thickness materials. They offer flexibility for holding down irregularly shaped workpieces without excessive force.

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_stepclamp2.jpg "Source - https://www.cnccookbook.com/easy-guide-to-cnc-clamps/"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### Fence

If you want an easy and reliable way to keep your material in place, a fence is a great option. A fence is simply a straight edge attached to the wasteboard, giving you a solid reference point for aligning your workpieces. It's often added on the bottom left side of your workspace, but can be placed anywhere. It‚Äôs especially handy if you're doing repeat jobs‚Äîno more constant measuring and repositioning. üéØ

![](/_images/_lmmk2/_the-basics/lmk2_work_fencenclamps.jpg) "Here the fences (left & bottom) are used along with a toe clamp (top) and eccentric clamp (right)"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

There are different ways to add a fence to your setup:

Fixed Fence: Screw it down or use threaded inserts for a permanent, rock-solid setup. Great for projects that require precise, repeatable alignment. üî©

Adjustable Fence: Use T-tracks or clamps to move the fence around when working with different-sized materials. More flexibility, but still keeps things steady!

#### Why Use a Fence?

**Better Accuracy**: Keeps your material square to the machine‚Äôs axes, reducing cutting mistakes. üéØ

**Saves Time**: Speeds up setup time for repeat jobs‚Äîno more fiddling around to get things aligned. ‚è≥

**Prevents Movement**: Helps stop material from shifting when the machine is doing its thing. üöÄ

#### Setting Up a Fence

Pick a straight, sturdy material like aluminum or MDF.

Secure it to the wasteboard using screws, threaded inserts, or clamps. üîß

Align the fence parallel to the X or Y axis so your cuts are precise. üìè

For extra repeatability, add alignment pins or dowel holes. üéØ

A fence works great alongside other hold-down methods like clamps or tape. Just remember, for heavier cuts, you might need some extra securing power!  Keep your projects locked in and running smooth!

**Tips:**

- Putting t-track in then putting thicker MDF slats in between like in the photo allows you to mill off the surface of the MDF to get a perfectly flat surface relative to your machine. It also enables you to make smaller wasteboard replacements, instead of needing to replace the whole board.
- If you have a thick enough waste bed, you can use your machine to cut the grooves for your t-track. Just cut grooves to fit the width of your t-track.
- We designed a custom t-track system that works with hex-headed 1/4"-20 hardware that you can see in our store here: <a href="https://sienci.com/product/t-track/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sienci.com/product/t-track/</a> and has a setup guide here: <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/assembling-add-ons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Installing the LongMill T-Track set</a>

### Vacuum Tables

Vacuum tables offer a high-tech solution for securing flat, lightweight materials such as thin sheets of wood, acrylic, and aluminum. They work by creating a suction that holds the material firmly in place, eliminating the need for physical clamps or adhesives. This method is ideal for projects where the material surface needs to remain untouched or where clamps would interfere with cutting paths.

While vacuum tables are highly efficient, they require an investment in additional equipment like a vacuum pump, and their effectiveness diminishes with irregular or porous materials.

**Where to Buy:**  

- CNC-specific equipment suppliers  
- Amazon

### Screws and Fasteners

Using screws or fasteners to secure materials directly to the wasteboard is a straightforward and highly secure method. It‚Äôs particularly effective for heavy or thick materials, such as hardwoods and metals, that require maximum stability during cutting. Screws are simple to use and provide a firm hold against strong cutting forces.

However, this method is invasive, as it requires drilling holes into your material or wasteboard. Careful planning is necessary to avoid damaging your final project or misplacing screws in the cutting path.

**Where to Buy:**  

- Hardware stores  
- Online retailers like Home Depot or Amazon

### Tabs and Bridges

Tabs and bridges are software-based solutions that work in tandem with physical workholding methods. During toolpath design, small tabs of uncut material are left in place to prevent pieces from shifting once they‚Äôre cut free from the main stock. These tabs are easily removed after machining and require minimal cleanup.

This method is highly reliable for projects with intricate designs but requires additional post-processing to remove and sand the tabs.

**Software Tools for Tabs:**  

- VCarve  
- Fusion 360

### Wedges

Wedges are a simple yet effective method for securing materials with uneven surfaces or unusual shapes. They work by pressing the material into a tight fit against fixed stops or clamps. This technique is commonly used for irregularly shaped pieces and can be made using scrap wood, making it a cost-effective solution.

However, wedges are best suited for projects that don‚Äôt require extreme precision, as the method relies heavily on manual adjustments.

**Where to Buy:**  

- Made from scrap materials or purchased as part of a workholding kit.

---

### Vice

A vise is a great workholding solution when machining small or irregularly shaped parts. By securely clamping the material between its jaws, a vise prevents movement and ensures precision during cutting.

It works well for metal, wood, and plastic, providing a stable grip without the need for adhesives or screws. For added versatility, soft jaws or custom inserts can be used to protect delicate materials or hold non-standard shapes. When using a vise, ensure it's properly aligned and tightened to avoid shifting, and consider adding parallels to keep the workpiece level for consistent milling.

**Where to Buy:**

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Profile-Workholding-Machine-Milling-Worktable/dp/B08C26KVD3/ref=pd_lutyp_ci_mcx_mr_typ_d_d_sccl_1_5/146-5834229-6751336) or your local hardware store

### Double-Sided Tape, Carpet tape or Adhesive Strips

Double-sided tape and adhesive strips are excellent for lightweight materials such as wood, acrylic, MDF, and small or thin pieces. These methods are non-invasive, meaning they won‚Äôt leave marks or require holes in your material. They allow for tight, flat placement, which is ideal for smooth surfaces and detailed work.

However, double-sided tape is not recommended for heavier materials or projects requiring strong cutting forces, as the adhesive may fail under significant pressure. Additionally, adhesive residue may require cleanup before finishing your project.

**Where to Buy:**  

- Nitto Tape on Amazon  
- 3M VHB Tape  

### Tape-and-CA Glue Method

This hybrid approach combines double-sided tape with cyanoacrylate (CA) glue for a strong, temporary hold. You place a layer of painter‚Äôs tape on both the material and the wasteboard, then apply CA glue between the tape layers to secure them together. This method offers the strength of adhesive without leaving residue on your material.

#### Tips

- Set your zero to the wasteboard and not the top of the material to ensure a consistent cut all the way through
- Medium viscosity CA glue takes a while to dry. Spread it around with a scraper on the tape. Apply sparingly to avoid leaks through the tape

**Where to Buy:**  

- CA glue and tape are widely available at hardware stores and online.
