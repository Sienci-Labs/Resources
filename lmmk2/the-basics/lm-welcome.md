Hello and welcome to the LongMill Resources section of the website. This has been made to act as your comprehensive guide on everything you need to know to start making things with your LongMill.

Each page will have buttons at the bottom to navigate step-by-step or you can use the sidebar to quickly travel to a desired page. Some pages also have tabs to switch between the beginner-friendly and advanced content. We have forums on our <a href="https://forum.sienci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website</a> and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mill.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> if you want to talk with others or have further questions.
