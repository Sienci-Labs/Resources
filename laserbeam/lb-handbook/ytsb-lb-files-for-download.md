As part of our open-source approach, we strive to maintain and release design files for our products. Users can access these files to inspire their own designs, or to create replacement parts for themselves. Feel free to 3D print them, laser cut or CNC them; you just need bring the files into a CAM program to create the g-code.

Find all the files for creating the parts in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1T16gqAR_Ovjij3CHFlmb7opbRqoXJ9T6">this Google Drive.</a>

All files are in DXF or SVG. In the drive you can find:
<ul>
  <li>G2 lens focus finder</li>
  <li>G7 lens focus finder</li>
  <li>G8 lens focus finder</li>
  <li>3 Element lens focus finder</li>
  <li>Steel mount</li>
  <li>Vortex riser mount</li>
</ul>
