When operating the 7W LaserBeam you will create smoke and other particulates that will get into the lens, lens focus ring, aluminum heat sink and laser assembly cooling fan which can affect performance. We recommend that you clean the lens with rubbing alcohol and a non-abrasive cloth such as a lens cleaning cloth, cotton swab or microfiber cloth. We recommend cleaning the remaining components  with rubbing alcohol and microfiber cloth. Cleaning on a regular basis will ensure peak performance and longevity of the 7W LaserBeam diode assembly.
