<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Read Through This Entire User &amp; Safety Manual Before Using The Sienci Labs 7W LaserBeam System</strong></span>

<a href="https://sienci.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7W-LaserBeam-Component-User-Safety-Manual-.pdf">https://sienci.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/7W-LaserBeam-Component-User-Safety-Manual-.pdf</a>

The 7W LaserBeam and any other laser device can cause harm to you or others. Ensure that you follow these safety guidelines.

<strong>Do not use a current meter on your LaserBeam driver:</strong> those of you who are having trouble getting your Laser to run might be tempted to use a multimeter or current meter to try testing the LaserBeam driver. Do not do this, the LaserBeam Driver produces a lot of current and when trying to measure it you will feed the current back into the driver damaging it and causing it to no longer work. This laser product is not a toy and handles large amounts of power that can be very dangerous for you and the equipment itself.

<b>Cut and engrave only laser safe materials:</b> Never cut materials that can generate toxic fumes or are dangerous to cut/engrave, such as
<ul>
  <li>PVC</li>
  <li>ABS</li>
  <li>Vinyl</li>
  <li>Fiberglass</li>
</ul>
<b>Wear eye protection:</b> Wear compatible laser safety goggles or glasses. Not wearing appropriate eye protection may cause permanent eye damage. The 7W LaserBeam comes with appropriate OD 7+ safety glasses. Ensure that the user and any personnel in the same room are wearing them before the laser is in use.  

<b>Never let the laser run unattended:</b> Ensure that you have a fire suppression system such as a fire extinguisher nearby in case of a fire. Never leave your laser unattended. Ensure that your laser is turned off when not in use.

<b>Static and surges:</b> Be aware that static electricity and power surges will degrade the performance of the laser diode. Take necessary steps to avoid this.

<b>Ensure proper ventilation:</b> Use the laser in a well-ventilated environment. Fumes and particulates from cutting or engraving can be harmful. We recommend having a fume extraction system or having an open door or window to provide ventilation.

***Please note that lasers are very dangerous. Use of controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those specified herein may result in hazardous radiation exposure. Sienci Labs is not responsible for injury or damage caused by the use or installation of this laser product.***
