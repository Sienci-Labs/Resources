In this section we will go over installing your lens and lens focus ring. If you need a reminder on the characteristics of each lens please <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lb-lenses/">check this resource page.</a>

Locate the lens you wish to install. The stock G2 lens and lens focus rings are found in the Small Parts bag. Any additional lens you ordered can be found in the main box. Make sure to keep the lens organized in their bags when not in use, since it may be difficult to tell them apart.

On each lens, there are notches at one end. This is where you will screw into the lens focus ring.

Pick which lens you wish to use, then screw the notched end into the threaded lens focus ring firmly.

The 3 Element (3E) lens has notches on both ends but only 1 set of notches is on the outside edge. The end with the larger outside notches will screw into the focus ring.

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Firmly secure lens into focus ring</em></p>
Take out the correct spring for the lens selected.
<ul>
  <li>7mm Lens Spring → G2 Lens</li>
  <li>10mm or 13mm Lens Spring → 3 Element, G7, G8 Lens</li>
</ul>
To make this part of the assembly easier, you can raise the Z-axis of your machine to the highest position.

First, use one hand to place the spring into the hole at the bottom of the laser diode. Then, use your other hand to screw in the assembled lens until just secured. Do not firmly fasten, you just need the lens to stay in place. But if it is very loose, feel free to add a second spring (of the same type) to increase tension.
