<h3>Initial Test</h3>
This Lightburn file was designed for testing laser functionality after assembly and setup, so that you could get a good idea of how the laser is working as-is, then adjust to improve performance. You can download the file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IjhHp_9g11VSxBX3Z8eFWSL8wA6AYu1V/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>
