In the same way you would for a CNC project, you will need to use a series of software programs (or a "toolchain") to bring a laser project idea into reality:
<ul>
  <li><b>Design</b> software – translating your project idea into a form that a computer can understand (optional, can find design files online) </li>
  <li><b>CAM</b> software – turning the project into a list of cutting instructions for your laser and CNC, through a "g-code file" </li>
  <li><b>Machine interface</b> software – communicating critical information between the controller and the laser, controlling it during setup  </li>
</ul>
The main difference between CNC and laser projects is that they will require different instructions, which can be generated by a laser-specific CAM software program. Sometimes the design and CAM software is combined, so you will only need 2 programs total.

<strong>To support you the best we can, we recommend <a href="https://lightburnsoftware.com/">LightBurn</a> as the 2-in-1 design and CAM software, and <a href="https://sienci.com/gSender/">gSender</a></strong><strong> (free) as the machine interface software for the LaserBeam.</strong>

However, we have also used <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> for design, and <a href="https://laserweb.yurl.ch/">LaserWeb</a> for CAM and machine interfacing, which are free options.
