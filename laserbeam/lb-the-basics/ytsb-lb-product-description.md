<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The LaserBeam 7Watt Diode Laser has been discontinued; some parts and accessories are still available <a href="https://sienci.com/product-category/laser-accessories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></strong></span>

The Sienci Labs 7W LaserBeam System is a plug and play add-on for the LongMill and AltMill CNC, giving them laser engraving and cutting capabilities.

The 7W LaserBeam attachment system consists of a laser diode, focusing lens, heat sinks, cooling fan and a 5A constant current driver. It allows you to engrave and cut laser safe material with accuracy and quality when paired with a CNC machine. This component is a Class 4 laser emitting device.

Before the fun can begin, you must make yourself aware of the risks that come with a laser product. Please review the <a href="https://resources.sienci.com/view/lb-manual/">safety guidelines and the user manual here.</a>

Happy making!
