CNC machines are adaptable tools capable of handling a wide range of projects. With the right add-ons, you can improve workflow, precision, safety, and creative flexibility. Here we introduce several common accessories that expand what your CNC can do.

## 1. IOT Relay ‚ö°Ô∏è

An IOT relay is a smart power control device that allows your CNC to automatically switch external tools on or off. When connected to your controller‚Äôs output signals, the relay can control a router, vacuum, or lighting automatically when a job starts or ends.

This automation simplifies workflow, improves safety, and helps keep your workspace organized. It ensures tools only run when needed, reducing wear and power usage.

Benefits

- Automatically powers on routers, vacuums, or lights during a job

- Improves workflow safety and consistency

- Reduces manual setup steps between runs

## Limit Switches üß≠

Limit switches define the boundaries of your CNC‚Äôs movement. Mounted at the ends of each axis, they prevent crashes by signalling the machine to stop when travel limits are reached. Limit switches also enable homing, which allows the machine to return to a known reference point automatically.

These switches are especially useful for repeatable setups, as they allow precise and consistent positioning from one job to the next.

Benefits

- Prevents crashes and mechanical over-travel

- Enables homing for repeatable starting positions

- Improves overall accuracy and workflow consistency

### Do I Need Limit Switches?

The LongMill does NOT need limit switches to operate and doesn't include them by default. Many individuals are drawn to having switches by convention, but most times a limit switch exists to either:

<ol>
  <li>Define soft or hard limits* in order to prevent a CNC from damaging itself if it travels past its movement limits</li>
  <li>Repeatably locate the machine (homing) for jogging / work offsets, saving a job that's gone bad, or to resume existing work done for a multi-part job</li>
</ol>

The LongMill design addresses these functions by way of:

<ol>
  <li>Being designed so that hitting the ends of its travel area causes zero damage to the machine
<ul>
  <li>In larger, more powerful machines such as VMCs and industrial CNC routers, crashing a machine can very well mean costly damage to your machine so limit switches are cheap insurance to prevent that. However, on hobby machines like the LongMill, the machine is not powerful enough to cause damage to itself, and so are not really necessary. In fact, in some cases, it can be more of a hassle as accidental triggers can ruin a project.</li>
</ul>

</li>
  <li>Locating the machine can easily be done via the use of a touch plate
<ul>
  <li>'Homing' is just the act of calibrating a CNC to a particular spot repeatably so that if, for example, you lose your CNC position due to a power outage or for a tool-change then you can find that position again using the offset distance from the calibrated point. This calibrated point can be set using limit switches but can just as easily be a touch plate or conductive geometry that a tool can touch off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

With this being said, some users may still choose to integrate switches into their machine if they start to find themselves running longer and longer jobs, performing more complex cuts, or they're looking for easier job relocation without having to keep their touch plate in mind.

*A soft limit is when there is a single switch on one side of the movement and the movement limit is defined in software, whereas a hard limit has two switches on either movement end which signal a 'Stop' to the controller if triggered.

## Touch Plate üìê

A touch plate helps your CNC machine automatically detect the exact position of your cutting tool relative to your workpiece. Instead of lowering the tool manually to find the surface, the machine uses electrical contact between the bit and the plate to determine a precise zero point.

When the tool touches the plate, it closes a small electrical circuit. The controller detects this contact and records the exact coordinates, setting your X, Y, and Z origins automatically. This saves time, improves repeatability, and reduces setup errors.

### Why Use a Touch Plate

- Faster setup: Zero multiple axes in seconds instead of manually jogging and testing.

- Higher accuracy: The machine measures exact contact, eliminating guesswork and ruler-based errors.

- Consistent results: Perfectly repeatable zero points across jobs, bits, and materials.

### How It Works

1. Connect the plate‚Äôs cable to the probe input on your CNC controller.

1. Attach the magnet lead to your router collet or cutting tool.

1. Place the touch plate on your material‚Äîusually on the front-left corner.

1. Run a probing cycle through your control software (like gSender or UGS).

1. The tool gently lowers until it touches the plate, setting your zero automatically.

Different plate designs‚Äîsuch as [standard block-style](https://sienci.com/product/touch-plate/) or [AutoZero plates](https://sienci.com/product/autozero/) allow probing along just the Z-axis (top of material) or all XYZ axes (material corner). Most modern senders, including gSender, UGS, and CNCjs, support automatic probing with touch plates.

## Spindle Kit üß∞

A **spindle** is a precision-built motor that replaces or upgrades a standard trim router on your CNC. Unlike routers, which are designed for hand use, spindles are purpose-built for CNC machining, offering smoother motion, better balance, less vibration, and fine-tuned speed control.  

Spindles excel at running long jobs, handling tougher materials, and maintaining consistent precision over time. They‚Äôre the go-to for makers looking to push their machine‚Äôs performance to a professional level.

### Benefits

- Quiet, balanced, and durable motor for precise cutting  
- Adjustable RPM for different materials and tool types  
- Brushless design = longer lifespan and lower maintenance  
- Cleaner surface finish and extended tool life  
- Designed for continuous-duty operation

## Cutting Fundamentals ‚öôÔ∏è

Before comparing routers and spindles, it helps to understand how cutting works. CNC cutting depends on the relationship between how **fast the bit moves**, how **fast it spins**, and **how much material it removes per pass**.  

The key terms are:  

- **Feed rate:** How quickly the tool moves through the material (X/Y direction).  
- **Plunge rate:** How fast it moves vertically (Z direction).  
- **Spindle speed:** How fast the bit spins, measured in RPM.  
- **Depth of cut (step down):** How deep the bit cuts per pass.  
- **Step over:** How far the tool shifts sideways between passes, often a percentage of bit diameter.  

Together, these make up what‚Äôs known as your **feeds and speeds**. Getting them right is critical:

| Setting too low | Result |
|------------------|---------|
| Feed rate too slow | Bit rubs and overheats |
| Feed rate too high | Bit breaks |
| Spindle too fast | Burns/melts material |
| Spindle too slow | Rough finish, chatter |

**Rule of thumb:**  
Higher RPM = smaller chips.  
Higher feed rate = larger chips.  

Aim for consistent, clean chip formation ‚Äî not dust, not chunks.  

> **Tip:** Always insert your bit as deeply as safely possible into the collet (at least 3/8"), especially for light cuts, to reduce chatter and improve accuracy.

## Routers vs. Spindles üîç

For most hobby CNC users, a **trim router** is the best starting point ‚Äî simple, affordable, and capable of handling most materials. A **spindle**, on the other hand, is the natural upgrade once you want more precision, quieter operation, and automated control.  

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_the-basics/cnc_ba_router-vsspindle.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

### Routers

Most CNC hobbyists use compact routers like the **Makita RT0700/RT0701**, known for their reliability and price.  

**Advantages:** 

- Affordable (typically under $150 USD)
- 1‚Äì1¬º HP power is plenty for wood and plastics  
- Wide speed range (10,000‚Äì30,000 RPM)  
- Easy plug-and-play setup  

**Limitations:**  

- Louder than spindles
- Manual on/off and speed control  
- Motor brushes wear out over time  

Routers provide an ‚Äúanalog‚Äù experience ‚Äî you manually set the speed dial and power switch. They‚Äôre perfect for newcomers, but as you move toward longer or more demanding jobs, their simplicity can become a bottleneck.

### Spindles

Spindles take performance a step further. Instead of plugging directly into the wall, a spindle motor connects to a **VFD (Variable Frequency Drive)**, which delivers clean, precise power and allows full software control over speed, direction, and operation.

**Advantages:**  

- Quieter and smoother operation  
- More torque and power (1.5 HP+)  
- Lower runout = cleaner cuts  
- Brushless, designed for continuous operation  
- Can be controlled directly by your g-code sender  

**Disadvantages:**  

- More expensive ($300‚Äì$1000+)  
- Heavier (requires sturdy mount)  
- More complex wiring and setup
