We‚Äôll use gSender as our working example to explain key CNC control concepts that apply to most G-code senders. gSender provides a clear and visual way to understand how your CNC machine interprets coordinates, sets origins, and manages movement through different systems like machine coordinates, workpiece coordinates, workspaces, homing, and setting limits. Even if you use a different sender, the principles discussed here, how the machine knows where it is, how you define your work area, and how to safely control motion‚Äîwill be the same. gSender just makes these concepts easier to see in action.

[Download](https://sienci.com/gSender/) gSender or [Read More](https://resources.sienci.com/view/gs-installation/) about how it works!

## Machine Coordinates vs Workpiece Coordinates

When you fire up gSender, and look to the right, above the Jog Controls is your DRO (Digital Read Out). This section allows you to do some automatic movement, set your zeros and see where you are in relation to the machine or the workpiece. Kinda like your car navigation system. You can also see if you are using mm or inches!

Before we dive into the buttons in the DRO and what they do, let's review how coordinates are handled. In other words, before we drive the car, let's look at the map.

In CNC machining, there are two primary coordinate systems that guide the machine's movements:

- [**Machine Coordinate System**](#machine-coordinate-system-)
- [**Workpiece Coordinate System**](#workpiece-coordinate-system-)

The **machine coordinate system** is a fixed, default system established by the CNC machine‚Äôs manufacturer. It is defined by the machine‚Äôs physical size and is used during the homing cycle, when the machine references its internal limits using built-in sensors like limit switches. Users do not modify or choose this system‚Äîit simply tells the machine where it is in its own space. If you are not using homing switches, the machine home is determined by where the bit is when the controller is powered on.

 In contrast, the **workpiece coordinate system** is fully controlled by the CNC user. This system defines the position of the part on the machine table and ensures the tool moves accurately in relation to the workpiece.

### Machine Coordinate System üè≠

The machine coordinate system refers to the CNC machine's own coordinate system, established by the manufacturer. This system is based on the machine's physical structure and its home position (often referred to as the machine's home or (0,0,0) point indicated by the **grey numbers**).

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-machinecordfull.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

When you power on the machine and perform a homing sequence, the machine references this built-in coordinate system to determine its position in space. This system ensures that the machine has a consistent reference point for all operations.‚Äã

### Workpiece Coordinate System üß±

The workpiece offset is a user-defined coordinate system that aligns the machine's operations with the specific location of the workpiece on the machine bed. This system allows users to set a new origin point (0,0,0) based on the workpiece's position.‚Äã This is indicated by the **blue numbers** in the DRO.

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-workpiececordfull.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

In gSender, you can set workpiece offsets using standard G-code commands like G54 to G59. These commands allow you to define multiple work coordinate systems, which is especially useful when working on different parts or setups without re-homing the machine each time.‚Äã These are called your workspaces.

## Workspaces

Usually you would only have one origin or zero position for your project. However, if you plan to do a series of projects that require different zero positions, or are lining up to do some more complex jigging or part batches, you may want to set up multiple workspaces all at once. This can save you time by not having to set a zero position for repetitive tasks or specific jig setups. You can do this by creating up to six different zero positions with the six workspaces in gSender. Access each 'Workspace' at the top right of the program by pressing the drop down to select which workspace to use. gSender will act completely in-line with whatever workspace you've selected, whether you want to set zero, probe, surface, or anything else.

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-workspacesdrop.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

The use of different **Workspaces** is most helpful when the machine is able to home the machine coordinate system. Once homed you can select a workspace and setup your project, and gSender will remember where you set the zero for the new workspace. The challenge then becomes placing the project in the correct spot for each workspace. Often a jig is created, to ensure perfect placement for your workpiece each time. You can use a workspace without homing/sensors, but it's not very repeatable, and you would be resetting them often with each power cycle.

In the image below you can see 4 different workspaces setup, with the zero in the bottom left corner, and the circle in the middle.

**Note:** *Some files may use a toolpath post processor that changes your workspace!*

The video below explains the process in greater detail. If you're coming from a more technical background, you'd usually call these 'workspaces' G54, G55, G56, ... G59.

## Homing & Limits

Limit switches (also referred to as *inductive sensors*, *end stops* or *homing switches*) are sensors that sit at one or both ends of each movement axis of a CNC to provide a few different functions. gSender provides unique features if you have these switches installed on your machine. You can check out our sensors [Sensor Kit](https://sienci.com/product/inductive-sensor-kit-for-the-longmill-mk2/)

### Homing

When we turn on homing, we can use 3 sensors to find our machine coordinate  home on our machine. For now, we will home to the front left corner of the machine. To enable Homing, Go to Config ‚ûú Homing/Limits ‚ûú Homing cycle enable ‚ûú toggle on.

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-homingon.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Using **grblHAL** enables several more detailed options for you to choose from, like homing single axes, requiring homing on startup, set machine origin to 0, and more. In this image, we have enabled homing, but **not** required it on startup. We have toggled to allow us to manually home the machine, and to **Set the machine origin to 0** once complete.

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-hominghal.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

You‚Äôll notice additional buttons appear in the DRO area of gSender:

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-homingbtn.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

The **Home** button is a convenient way to home or re-home your machine at any time (sends the typical $h command). The machine will automatically move to your front left corner, using the sensors to position the router over machine home.

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-rapidpositionbtn.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Four **Rapid-Travel** buttons to move your CNC at its maximum speed to any of your machine's 4 corners (offset by 5mm). **These should only be used once your machine is homed.**

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-parkbtn.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

You can configure a **Park Location** to move your router to a set spot consistently at the click of a button. To setup your parking spot, Go to Config ‚ûú Homing/Limits and scroll down to the bottom of the section. Here you can enter the coordinates of your parking spot manually, or move your router/spindle to the spot you wish to park and hit the **Grab** current position button. Test out your new spot by hitting the Go to button in settings or hitting the P button on the DRO. Don't forget to hit the Apply Settings button to save your new spot!

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-parksetting.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

### Setting Limits

If you‚Äôre having issues with the ‚Äúquick-travel‚Äù buttons, then check the **maximum travel** settings for your machine to see if they are the same as what your machine is physically capable of moving. You can find these settings by going to Config tab ‚ûú Homing/Limits ‚ûú X-axis maximum travel (Y, Z axes are here too), $130-$132. If you are using **grblHAL** you will also see A axis, $133.

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-limitssetl.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

### Soft Limits

With 3 sensors in place, and homing turned on, we can turn on soft limits. This feature will combine your 3 sensor homing cycle with your maximum travel lengths, to prevent you from going too far on each axis. Think of this as a software limit, we use 3 limit switches + your max travel to calculate your soft limits. To enable soft limits, Config ‚ûú Homing/Limits ‚ûú Soft limits enable ‚ûú toggle on. Don't forget to hit the Apply Settings button to save!

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-softlimit.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

### Hard Limits

If you have a sensor on both sides of each axis, all 6 sensors can provide you a hardware backup solution, to the software solution provided above with the soft limits. With hard limits on, if your machine get's close to the edge of an axis, your sensor will trigger, stopping any further movement. To enable hard limits, Config ‚ûú Homing/Limits ‚ûú Hard limits enable ‚ûú toggle on. Don't forget to hit the Apply Settings button to save!

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-hardlimit.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

## Set Zero and Go tos

Each g-code file or project will have a starting position that all other movements are referenced off of. This is called the **Workpiece zero**. There are two ways to manually set your zero on gSender:

1. Zero each axis one at a time using 'X0', 'Y0', and 'Z0' buttons
1. Set them all at the same time with the larger Zero button

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_handbook/_machine-coords/cnc_ha_machine_dro-setzero.jpg){.aligncenter .size-full}

The large blue numbers tell you the current position of your machine. Once you set the zero of each axis, they will all read 0.00.

You can reset your zeros anytime when the machine is not actively running a job. The machine will remember your zero in most cases unless you forcibly move it by hand, but even then CNCs with homing can re-home and still return to the zero point.
