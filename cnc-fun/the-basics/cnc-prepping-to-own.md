## Setting Expectations

Youâ€™ve done the research, charted your course, purchased your CNC, and now youâ€™re ready to set sail on your CNC journey â€” steady at the helm, creativity as your guiding star. You can already picture the incredible projects youâ€™ll bring to life, each one a step forward, heading toward mastering your craft. Just like Christopher Columbus in 1492, let's explore the unknown waters of preparing to be a CNC owner. (Can you imagine the boats they would build it they had CNC's back then?)

These four points of interest have been marked on your treasure map to begin...

**Before you cast off** -> ðŸ’¨ Take a deep breath and see which way the wind is blowing.

Prepare for your journey by checking out the [learning curve](#learning-curve) you are about to embark upon. Take a deep breath, learn from any mistakes and keep going!<br>

**Building the boathouse** -> ðŸš¢  We're gonna need a bigger boat - house. Or do we?

Explore [space requirements](#space-requirements), research the [power requirements](#power-requirements) and analyze the different [costs](#initial-costs) to get your shop setup and ready to roll<br>

**Maintain your equipment** -> ðŸ§­ Why does it feel like your ship is veering off course?

Get back on track with [machine maintenance](#machine-maintenance) tips to keep your CNC running smoothly<br>

**Coast Guard to the rescue** -> ðŸª£ Did you pack a bucket to bail out the water?

You can always rely on your fellow sailors to offer a helping hand in [the community](https://forum.sienci.com/). Think of the forum as your *Navy Boot Camp*, ready to help you troubleshoot, learn, and grow.<br>

**It's time to get excited, because learning to CNC is a journey!** With our guidance and the help of the community, you'll be more than prepared to chart your course, hoist the sails, and be ready to explore the learning waters ahead while avoiding common icebergs along the way.

## Learning Curve

There are many moving parts when it comes to producing something from your new CNC machine. An interesting intersection of technology and woodworking. There are several steps to each stage that you can work your way through, to come out with something great on your first try. Make a couple tweaks to your design, and run the job again, and all of the sudden you have something to really be proud of! Know that you will make some mistakes along the way, but embrace them if you can as learning moments. Store that memory away, and prevent it from happening again. Let's explore some of the new skills you will be learning about, acquiring, and eventually mastering. **You got this!**

- **Commonly used Terms**<br> It will sometimes feel like you are learning an entirely new language. Terms like *controller, toolpath, endmill and workholding* are all important to know. Check out this article on [Common CNC Terms](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-common-cnc-terms/)
- **Software Skills**<br> A significant part of CNC woodworking involves learning CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software. Programs like Fusion 360, Easel, or VCarve have varying degrees of complexity, and mastering them takes time. The good news is, you don't need to be a master to make cool stuff, right out of the gates.
- **Toolpaths and Settings**<br> Beyond software, understanding toolpaths (how the machine moves), feed rates, spindle speeds, and materials will come into play. These settings directly affect the success of your projects.
- **Patience Required**<br> Expect to spend a good amount of time experimenting and learning through trial and error. Your first few projects may not be perfect, and thatâ€™s completely normal.
- **Learn about Wood**<br> There are a couple things to focus on learning, including how to measure wood, where to buy it, and how to store it.

This video is a good overview of the entire CNC process, followed by some simple projects you can begin with.

### Failure is Part of the Process

- **Trial and Error**<br> Donâ€™t be discouraged if your first attempts donâ€™t go as planned. Itâ€™s common to break bits, misalign materials, or get unexpected results. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
- **Material Wastage**<br> You will likely waste some material during the learning phase, whether from incorrect settings or accidents. Plan for some losses as you refine your skills.

Mistakes happen, let's review some of the common ones!

https://youtu.be/Vh6OzYyd840

We all need to laugh at ourselves every now and again, so here are some shorts to giggle with. These are those icebergs we are hoping to avoid ourselves. Many people in this hobby have a bin for mistakes labelled **Firewood!!** Not only do you get to make really cool things, you also get to make a bunch of dust, and some really cool looking firewood. Isn't it nice when people share their mistakes so we can all learn from them?

[/su_table]

### Time Commitment

- **Setup and Testing**<br> Expect a significant amount of time to be spent on project setup - finalizing the design, securing the workpiece, setting up toolpaths, and making sure everything is aligned. The amount of time spent before you start carving, can often be more than the time it takes to carve!! Testing new designs or tool setups on scrap materials is often necessary too.
- **Project Completion**<br> Projects can take longer than expected, especially if you are refining a design, troubleshooting issues, or making multiple passes on a complicated cut. Patience is key. Often a *roughing pass* is used first to remove the bulk of material, then a *finishing pass* comes along and really smooths thing up.

### Community Support

- **Learning from Others**<br> The CNC woodworking community is large and active. Online forums, YouTube tutorials, and CNC groups are invaluable resources for troubleshooting, tips, and inspiration. Youâ€™re not alone in the learning process. Join us on our [community forum!](https://forum.sienci.com/)
- **Asking for Help**<br> Donâ€™t hesitate to ask questions when you get stuck. Most CNC enthusiasts are willing to share their knowledge and help you through challenges.

### **Space Requirements**

Setting up your CNC woodworking machine doesn't take up much space at all. You can mount it to a workbench, a table, under the table, or even the wall. You can keep your bits in a drawer and begin carving right away! As you progress in skill and project complexity, you'll find you can use more space than just for the machine itself. Know that you can start off with a simple CNC machine on a table, some simple hand tools and still have great success.

Let's check out a full single car garage shop and explore some things to consider:

![](/_images/_cnc-fun/_the-basics/cnc_ba_prepping-shop1.jpg "Note the two blue arrows indicating this shop has installed a separate power line on the ceiling"){.aligncenter .size-medium}

1. **Wood Storage**<br>
  Youâ€™ll need a space to store wood materials, whether itâ€™s sheets of plywood, hardwoods, or other materials. Itâ€™s a good idea to designate a dry, organized area to prevent wood warping or damage and to ensure easy access during projects. *Keep out spiders!*

2. **Tools**<br>
  Over time, youâ€™ll accumulate a variety of hand tools, sandpaper, clamps, and accessories. Make sure you have proper storage for these tools near your CNC machine to ensure quick access. Having access to a power bar is also very handy.

3. **Bits**<br>
  Having the original containers for bit or a small shelf or storage bin will help avoid misplacing or damaging small, delicate items like your cutting tools. The shop pictured above has carpet down to prevent any dropped bits from breaking too.

4. **Table**<br>
  Your CNC machine will need a sturdy, flat table or workbench to rest on. You may want to plan for extra space on the left side of your table to allow you to mount the controller or E-stop button. Note that the new AltMill includes a table!
  
5. **Dust Collection**<br>
  CNC projects generate a lot of dust, so a proper dust collection system is essential. This could be a small vacuum setup like pictured above, or a dedicated wall mounted dust collector to keep your workspace clean and prevent damage to your machine and electronics, like pictured below.

[/su_table]

### Power Requirements

When setting up your shop, itâ€™s important to consider the power requirements of both the **controller**, the **router** or **spindle** used, and any other tools added. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown:

1. **Controller** ([SuperLongBoard](https://sienci.com/product/slb/))
   - The **SLB** requires a **24V** external power supply with a **10-12A capacity** to run. This adds up to about **2 amps** on a 120V circuit which is relatively low, but combined with a spindle or router and other equipment, itâ€™s still essential to keep an eye on your overall power usage.
1. **Router Power** ([Makita 1.25HP](https://sienci.com/product/makita-rt0701c-1-25-hp-110v-compact-router/))
   - Many hobbyists start with a **router** instead of a spindle. Routers, like the **Makita RT0701C**, draw around **6-7 amps** on 120V circuits. This is much less than a spindle, making routers a good option if youâ€™re working with limited power supply.
1. **Spindle Power**
   - Spindles come in different power levels, which affects how much electricity they use. Common spindles range from **0.8KW** to **2.2KW**.
     - A **1.5KW spindle** running on **120V** usually draws about **12.5 amps**.
     - A **2.2KW spindle** on **120V** can draw up to **18 amps**.
   - For typical 120V circuits (like the ones with **15A breakers** found in many workshops), a **1.5KW spindle** is about the highest you can use without risking a tripped breaker. Larger spindles, like a **2.2KW**, might need a dedicated circuit with a higher amperage or use of a **220V** outlet.

So, if youâ€™re using a **1.5KW spindle** with the SLB on a standard 120V, 15A circuit, youâ€™ll be close to capacity. Adding a dust collection system or other devices might push you over, requiring a separate circuit. Alternatively, if youâ€™re using a **router**, youâ€™ll have more breathing room for other equipment.

Always double-check your circuitâ€™s breaker ratings to avoid overloading your workshopâ€™s electrical setup.

### **Initial Costs**

There are a couple main costs to consider when entering the CNC hobby. You can start with as little as a CNC, table and laptop! Some companies will offer beginner bundles like the [Starter End Mill Set](https://sienci.com/product/sems/) for example. These can be a great way to save some money and get a variety of bits to start with.

- **Machine Cost**<br> CNC machines come in a range of prices depending on size, precision, and brand. Hobby-level machines can start around $500â€“$2,000, while more advanced or larger machines can go well beyond $5,000.
- **Additional Costs**<br> Youâ€™ll also need software for designing your projects, which could involve one-time purchases or subscription fees. Accessories like end mills, clamps, dust collection systems, and materials (wood, MDF, etc.) will add to your initial investment.

#### Optional Add-Ons

Over time, you may want to upgrade parts, like getting better tooling, a quieter dust collection system or adding additional features (such as an upgraded spindle, automatic tool changer or a laser engraver). Every shop is a bit different, and customizing yours to fit your needs is always a fun challenge. It's not uncommon to reshuffle/reorganize your shop after you've had your CNC for a bit and understand where you want things. Many users will already have a computer, mouse, keyboard, saw, workbench, etc. before you begin with your new CNC, which can really save you money starting up.

In the chart below we explore many of the things you may want to consider adding to your shop, before your end mill starts spinning. Don't fret too much about 'keeping up with the Joneses', you can start slow and build up your extras when you are ready.

## Machine Maintenance

- **[Regular Upkeep](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-maintenance/)**<br> CNC machines require regular maintenance to perform optimally. This includes cleaning your rails & wheels, lubricating parts, checking for loose bolts, and inspecting wiring and belts. Some software like [gSender](https://resources.sienci.com/view/gs-installation/) will help you track the number of hours you have been running your machine, and recommend specific maintenance be performed.
- **[Replacing Parts](https://sienci.com/product-category/parts/)**<br> Over time, youâ€™ll need to replace things like the cutting tools, which dull with use, or v-wheels, linear bearings, and delrin nuts that wear out. Knowing how to maintain your machine will help avoid costly breakdowns. Just like replacing tires or windshield wipers on your car.
- **[Calibration](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-checks-and-first-moves/#tuning-movement)**<br> Keeping your machine properly calibrated is key for accuracy. Routine checks on squareness, zeroing, and other factors will save you time and material in the long run.

### Final Thought: **Start Small**

Itâ€™s tempting to jump straight into large or complex projects, but starting with simpler tasks will help you build confidence and understand your machine. Set realistic expectations for your first few months, focus on mastering the basics, and steadily work your way up to more advanced projects. Embarking on your CNC journey can be incredibly rewarding, but it requires patience, learning, and ongoing investment. Enjoy the milestones as you learn new skills and upgrade your projects along the way.

**Stay curious, embrace the mistakes as learning opportunities and you may just find your very own gold treasure! May the winds always be at your back.**
