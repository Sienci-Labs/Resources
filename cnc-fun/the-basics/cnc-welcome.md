## Navigation

You may want to jump straight into areas like:

| [ðŸ’» Software](https://resources.sienci.com/view/gen-software-explained/) | [ðŸ”§ Add-ons](https://resources.sienci.com/view/gen-touchplate/) | [ðŸ“” Handbook](https://resources.sienci.com/view/gen-running-jobs/) |

\[su\_button url="https://resources.sienci.com/view/gen-touchplate/" style="flat" size="8" radius="3" background="var(--sl-blue)" color="#FFFFFF" center="yes"\]ðŸ”§ Add-ons\[/su\_button\]

\[su\_button url="https://resources.sienci.com/view/gen-running-jobs/" style="flat" size="8" radius="3" background="var(--sl-blue)" color="#FFFFFF" center="yes"\]ðŸ“” Handbook\[/su\_button\]

If youâ€™re just getting started, you might first explore software options, follow assembly instructions, or dive into a condensed handbook of best practices.

For smoother navigation:

1. Resources are divided into sections like chapters. Browse through basics, software, add-ons, and a handbook for everyday use.  
2. Use search to quickly find specific terms or topics.  
3. The **Page Contents** feature helps jump to sections within a page. (On mobile, this often appears at the top.)  
4. Save or print pages for offline reference.

At the bottom of each page, navigation buttons let you move step by stepâ€”like flipping through a manualâ€”to follow a logical learning path.
