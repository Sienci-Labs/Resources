NOTES

- Index can be removed as WP creates it based on header. I used it to navigate in this doc.
- AI pics are used for each header and can be removed. Playing around to see if it could be of use. Fairly generic, so thought I'd include them for fun.
- I can add pics of cans of stain and finish and more paint if you think that would be helpful
- Hard to tell how the pics will turn out, as they don't format in the preview on git

## 1. Sanding

Sanding is essential for smoothing rough surfaces left by the CNC process, removing imperfections, and preparing wood for finishing. Use different **hand tools** (sandpaper, sanding block, sanding sponge) or **power tools** (orbital sander, detail sander, belt sander) depending on the task. Choose the correct grit to begin and follow the grit progression (rough, medium, fine) for the best results.

**Breaking the edge** (rounding off sharp corners) enhances safety, finish quality, and durability, while **raising the grain** prevents wood fibers from lifting when applying water-based finishes.

For best results, always sand in the direction of the grain, use protective gear, and consider the project requirements when choosing your tools and techniques.

> ***Tip:** Always protect yourself when sanding with protective glasses and a dusk mask.*

### Hand Sanding Tools

Hand sanding tools are ideal for precision work, tight spaces, or when you want more control over the sanding process.

#### **Sandpaper**

- Coated abrasive paper available in different grits. You can fold it or cut it into smaller pieces to use by hand. Check out the [grit guide](#grit-guide) below.
  - **Usage**: Use lower grit for aggressive sanding and higher grits for finishing
  - **Types**: Aluminum oxide (general use), silicon carbide (wet/dry), garnet (fine finishing)

   ![](/_images/_experimental-writing/sandpaper.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Sanding Block**

- A block used to hold sandpaper flat for even sanding. Cut a strip of sandpaper and attach to the sanding block. Fast & comfortable to use
  - **Usage**: Prevents uneven sanding and helps apply uniform pressure

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/sandingblock.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Sanding Sponge**

- Flexible sponge coated with abrasive material. No sandpaper needed as it's already on the sponge!
- **Usage**: Ideal for contours, curves, and irregular surfaces

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/sandingsponge.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

### Power Sanding Tools

Power tools make the sanding process quicker and are ideal for larger surfaces or more intensive sanding tasks.

#### **Orbital Sander**

- A handheld sander that moves in small circles. You can also get a random orbital sander, that moves randomly instead of in circles
  - **Usage**: General-purpose sanding, producing a fine finish with minimal swirl marks

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/orbitalsander.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Detail Sander**

- Small triangular-shaped sander
  - **Usage**: Designed for tight spaces, corners, and detailed work

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/detailsander.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Hand Drill & Dremel**

- Uses drum, disc or mop sanding attachments that fit into a dremel or drill. These can be found online.
  - **Usage**: Use when light sanding is required or the surface is quite soft. Mops are great to get into tight spaces to remove wood fuzz

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/dremel.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/dremelsandingbits.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

#### **Belt Sander**

#### **Drum Sander**

- A large, stationary sander with a rotating drum
  - **Usage**: Ideal for sanding large surfaces such as wooden floor boards. Great for removing old paint, varnish or discolourations and for levelling and smoothing large surfaces

![](/_images/_experimental-writing/drumsander.webp){.aligncenter .size-medium}

By choosing the right tool for each stage, you can achieve a high-quality finish on your woodworking projects.

### Choosing the right Grit

**Grit** refers to the particles of sand that make up the sandpaper. Larger, fewer particles with more space between them is coarse grit. The smaller and more packed together the particles, the finer the grit. Coarse sandpaper removes imperfections faster and with less effort than fine sandpaper – which is great if you are trying to shape or level. Fine grit is used for the later stages of wood sanding – for smoothing and polishing. The higher the sandpaper’s grit, the smoother the result. Begin with a coarser grit to level the wood, then buff scratches with finer grits until you reach the desired smoothness. It is important to move through the grits and not skip from a rough one, straight to a fine one.

***Tip**: The golden rule of sanding, is to move the sandpaper in the same direction as the wood grain. This reduces visible scratches and results in a smoother finish.*

### Grit Guide

| **Step**          | **Grit Level**    | **Purpose**                              |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Rough Sanding     | 60-100 grit       | Removes large burrs, rough edges.        |
| Medium Sanding    | 120-150 grit      | Smoothens the surface, removes tool marks. |
| Fine Sanding      | 220-320 grit      | Prepares for paint/stain, smooth texture. |

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Start with Rough Sanding (80-100 Grit):**  
   Use this grit to remove any visible tool marks or uneven surfaces created by the CNC machine. You can shape the wood a bit or break the edge if desired.

1. **Medium Sanding (120-150 Grit):**  
   Smooth out any remaining roughness, ensuring an even surface. Use an orbital sander or sanding block for flat surfaces.

1. **Fine Sanding (220-320 Grit):**  
   This grit is for a silky-smooth finish, ideal before applying paint, stain, or sealant. Do be aware that the higher the grit you use at this stage, will reduce the ability of stains and finished to penetrate the wood. If you are using 1000 grit for example, you are no longer cutting the wood, but packing sawdust into the wood pours, burnishing it. The surface will become shiny and very smooth, but not allow stain or seal to penetrate fully.

### Sanding Tips & Videos

> - **Safety Tips**: Wear protective gear (safety glasses, dust mask). Use a dust collection system or sand in a well-ventilated area.<br>
> - **Tip**: For curved or intricate designs, consider using sanding sponges, soft pads, or hand sanding to access tight spaces. Depending on your project, getting into the crevices of your design can be difficult. Small scrapers are handy to remove fuzzy bits. What if you carved a 3d relief? Sanding mops in different grits work great here. They can get into the details without removing too much material and ruining the design.

## Advanced Sanding

### Raising the grain

Raising the grain is an essential step, especially when working with water-based finishes. The process involves initial sanding, wetting the wood, sanding again, then moving on to other finishing steps.

#### Why raise the grain?

When you apply water-based finishes or stains to wood, the wood fibers absorb moisture and swell, causing the grain to rise, which results in a rough texture. By raising the grain beforehand and sanding it smooth, you prevent this from happening after the finish or stain is applied, ensuring a smoother final result.

- **Prepares the wood**: Especially important when applying water-based stains, paints, or sealers.
- **Prevents rough surfaces**: Stops the grain from rising after the finish is applied, ensuring a smooth final result.

#### Raise the grain process

1. **Sand the Wood**
   Sand your wood project to a smooth finish using progressively finer grits of sandpaper (start with 120 grit and work up to 220 grit or finer).
   Make sure the surface is free of any visible scratches or rough spots.

1. **Moisten the Surface**
   Use a damp cloth to lightly moisten the surface of the wood with a clean, damp cloth. You don’t want to soak the wood, just enough moisture to slightly wet the surface. Make sure the water is put on evenly across the entire surface to raise the grain evenly.

1. **Allow the Wood to Dry**
   Let the surface to air-dry completely. This usually takes 1-2 hours, depending on the humidity. As the wood dries, the fibers will rise, creating a rough texture on the surface.

1. **Sand the Raised Grain (220-320 Grit)**
   Once the wood is completely dry, lightly sand the surface with fine-grit sandpaper (320 or higher). The goal is to knock down the raised fibers without removing too much material or damaging the wood. Use light pressure and sand with the grain to avoid scratches. Feel the wood to ensure it’s smooth again.

1. **Continue with the Next Finishing Steps**
   After raising the grain and sanding it smooth, you can proceed to apply your stain or finish. Since you’ve pre-raised the grain, the finish or stain will go on smoother and result in a more even texture. Keep in mind:

   - Water-Based finishes tend to raise the grain more than oil-based finishes, so it’s especially important to raise the grain beforehand if you’re using water-based products.
   - Oil-based stains and finishes don't raise the grain as much, but it’s still a good practice to prepare the wood properly.

By raising the grain and sanding it smooth before finishing, you’ll end up with a much smoother and more professional finish, especially when using water-based products.

> **Tip**: Always raise the grain before applying water-based products to ensure a professional-looking finish.

### Break the edges

Breaking the edges is a common woodworking practice that serves several important purposes. The process involves a simple sanding of the sharp edges during or upon completion of your project, with a sanding block.

#### Why break the edges?

- **Safety and Comfort**
Sharp edges can be a safety hazard because they are more prone to chipping or breaking off during handling. Additionally, sharp edges can cut or cause splinters, making the finished piece less comfortable to touch or use.

- **Improved Finish Quality**
Sanding sharp edges helps paint, stain, or varnish adhere better. Sharp corners tend to accumulate excess finish, leading to uneven coverage. By softening the edges, you ensure that the finish is more evenly applied and visually appealing.

- **Reduced Risk of Tear-Out**
Sharp edges are more likely to experience tear-out, especially when cutting or routing. By slightly rounding or chamfering the edges, you reduce the chance of fibers breaking off, resulting in a cleaner look.

- **Aesthetic Appeal**
Softened or rounded edges often look more refined and professional compared to sharp edges. The softened profile can enhance the overall visual balance of the project and make the design appear more intentional and polished.

- **Longer Lifespan**
Rounded edges are less susceptible to damage from impact or wear and tear over time. This durability is especially important for furniture pieces or items that will experience regular use.

#### Break the edge process

To do this, simply use a medium or fine grit sanding block, to make a couple of passes over each sharp edge at a 45-degree angle. You can do this before assembly, and repeat until the edge is softened to your preference.

> ***Tip** A metal file is surprisingly good for breaking edges when you go to sand your wood*

## 3. Staining

Staining wood offers a natural and elegant way to enhance the grain and color of the wood while still providing protection and durability. Wood stain penetrates the surface, allowing the texture and beauty of the wood to remain visible, unlike paint, which covers it. Stains come in a variety of shades, offering plenty of design options while preserving the wood's organic appearance.

The process involves applying the stain evenly, letting it soak into the wood, and wiping off the excess. Multiple coats can be applied for a richer finish, and **pre-stain conditioner** is recommended for softwoods to ensure even absorption.

> ***Tip:** Proper surface preparation, such as sanding, is crucial for an even and smooth stain application.*

### Step-by-Step Staining Process

1. **Pre-Stain Conditioner (Optional but Recommended):**  
   Use a wood conditioner on softwoods (e.g., pine, maple) to ensure even stain absorption.

1. **Apply Stain with a Brush or Cloth**:  
   Work the stain into the wood, following the grain. Wipe away excess after 5-10 minutes.

1. **Let the Stain Dry**:  
   Allow at least 4-6 hours (oil-based) or 1-2 hours (water-based) before applying a second coat or moving to the sealing stage.

1. **Apply Additional Coats (Optional)**:  
   If you want a deeper color, you can apply multiple coats, allowing full drying between each.

## 4. Sealing

Applying a wood finish is essential for enhancing both the appearance and longevity of your project. A wood finish helps protect the surface from wear, moisture, and environmental damage, while also adding a subtle sheen that highlights the wood’s natural beauty. Unlike stains or paints, finishes are typically clear or semi-transparent, preserving the wood’s original color and grain.

The application process involves evenly applying the finish, allowing it to dry, and lightly sanding between coats for a smooth, professional look. You may also want to choose between different finishes like **oil-based**, **water-based**, or **lacquer**, depending on the desired effect and durability.

> ***Tip:** A good sealant assists in preventing paint from bleeding into your projects that may use a V bit to carve a sign. You may want to use a sealant during parts of your carve to keep lines & text sharp.*

### Sealer Types

| **Sealer Type**      | **Finish**              | **Best For**                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Polyurethane          | Gloss/Satin/Matte       | High-traffic areas, durability.              |
| Lacquer               | High Gloss, Fast Drying | Professional-quality finish, easy to repair. |
| Shellac               | High Gloss              | Easy to apply, traditional wood finish.      |
| Wax                   | Soft, Matte Finish      | Low durability, but smooth, natural look.    |

### Step-by-Step Sealing Process

1. **Clean the Surface**:<br>
   Remove any dust and debris:  from the CNC process using a soft brush or vacuum.
   Inspect for Imperfections: Check for any rough edges, burn marks, or tool marks. Sand these areas smooth.

1. **Apply Sealer with a Brush or Rag**:  
   Start with a thin layer. Apply evenly, following the wood grain

1. **Allow to Dry Fully**:  
   Drying times vary depending on the product (typically 4-24 hours)

1. **Sand Lightly Between Coats (320+ Grit)**:  
   This removes any dust or imperfections, ensuring a smooth final finish

1. **Apply 2-3 Coats for Maximum Protection**:  
   More coats provide better durability and water resistance, especially for surfaces exposed to moisture
