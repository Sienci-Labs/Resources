## Setting Expectations

You’ve done the research, plotted your course, and now you’re ready to set sail on your CNC journey—oars steady, full speed ahead. You’re imagining the incredible creations you’ll craft, masterpieces that will catch the world’s eye, and maybe one day find their place in a museum! But wait... is that a storm on the horizon? (Prepare for a flood of [information](https://resources.sienci.com/)) Why does it feel like your ship is veering off course? (Ah, that’s the reality of [machine maintenance](https://resources.sienci.com/view/lmk2-maintenance/)) Did you pack a bucket to bail out the water? (Don’t worry, [the community](https://forum.sienci.com/) is your lifeboat)

We understand the excitement—you're eager to hoist the sails and catch the wind! But before you set off, let’s chart your course, explore the learning waters ahead, and point out a few icebergs to watch for on the journey.

Use this section as the intro to:
The Extra Stuff
The Shop Setup
The Learning Path
Machine Maintenance

### **Initial Costs**

- **Machine Cost:** CNC machines come in a range of prices depending on size, precision, and brand. Hobby-level machines can start around $500–$2,000, while more advanced or larger machines can go well beyond $5,000.
- **Additional Costs:** You’ll also need software for designing your projects, which could involve one-time purchases or subscription fees. Accessories like end mills, clamps, dust collection systems, and materials (wood, MDF, etc.) will add to your initial investment.
- **Upgrades:** Over time, you may want to upgrade parts, like getting better tooling or adding additional features (such as an upgraded spindle or a laser engraver).

### Those sneaky extra costs

| **Category**                                | **Estimated Cost (USD)**                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

| **Software (VCarve Pro, others)**           | *$0 - $699*                                               |
| **Supplies (workholding, sandpaper, oils, etc.)** | *$100 - $500*                                             |
| **Table (worktable + wasteboard + enclosure)** | *$200 - $600*                                             |
| **Total Estimated Cost:**                     | **$1,150 - $4,550** |

### **Space Requirements**

![](ncfs_lm_shoppic2.jpg){.aligncenter .size-medium}

Setting up your CNC woodworking area requires careful planning, as you'll need more space than just for the machine itself. Here are some critical aspects to consider:

1. **Wood Storage**  
  You’ll need a space to store wood materials, whether it’s sheets of plywood, hardwoods, or other materials. It’s a good idea to designate a dry, organized area to prevent wood warping or damage and to ensure easy access during projects.

2. **Tools**  
  Over time, you’ll accumulate a variety of hand tools, sandpaper, clamps, and accessories. Make sure you have proper storage for these tools near your CNC machine to ensure quick access. Having access to a power bar is also very handy.

3. **Bits**
  Having the original containers for bit or a small shelf or storage bin will help avoid misplacing or damaging small, delicate items like end mills and bits.

4. **Table**
  Your CNC machine will need a sturdy, flat table or workbench **(link to ad-tables-enclosures.md update)** to rest on.
  
5. **Dust Collection:**
  CNC projects generate a lot of dust, so a proper dust collection system **(Link to ad-dust-collection.md update)** is essential. This could be a small vacuum setup or a dedicated dust collector to keep your workspace clean and prevent damage to your machine and electronics.

The **Sienci Labs SuperLongBoard (SLB)** and the spindle you'll be using with your CNC setup have specific power requirements you should be aware of, particularly when it comes to **amp draw**.

1. **Spindle Power Draw**:
   - The **spindle** size and power rating will greatly influence the amp draw. Common spindles range from **0.8KW** to **2.2KW**, with their power needs being higher based on their wattage. For example:
     - A **1.5KW spindle** running on **120V** will typically draw around **12.5 amps**.
     - A **2.2KW spindle** on **120V** can draw up to **18 amps**.
   - If your electrical system is based on **110V/120V** with standard **15A breakers**, a **1.5KW spindle** is usually the highest you can safely run without tripping breakers. For larger spindles (like 2.2KW), you'll either need a dedicated circuit with higher amperage or operate on **220V**

2. **SuperLongBoard (SLB) Power**:
   - The **SuperLongBoard** itself will require an external power supply, often around **24V with a 10A capacity**. Ensure that your total system, including the spindle, dust collection, and the CNC controller, does not overload your electrical circuits

In summary, a **1.5KW spindle** combined with the SLB will draw close to **12.5A**, which should work on a standard 120V, 15A circuit, but adding dust collection or other devices may require a dedicated circuit. If you opt for a **2.2KW spindle**, consider upgrading to a **220V circuit** to avoid tripping your breakers.

Make sure to plan your workshop's electrical setup to accommodate these requirements, and always check your circuit's breaker ratings to prevent overloading.

### 3. **Learning Curve**

- **Software Skills:** A significant part of CNC woodworking involves learning CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) software. Programs like Fusion 360, Easel, or VCarve have varying degrees of complexity, and mastering them takes time.
- **Toolpaths and Settings:** Beyond software, understanding toolpaths (how the machine moves), feed rates, spindle speeds, and materials is crucial. These settings directly affect the success of your projects.
- **Patience Required:** Expect to spend a good amount of time experimenting and learning through trial and error. Your first few projects may not be perfect, and that’s completely normal.
- **Learn about wood** How to measure, where to purchase, how to store it

### 4. **Failure is Part of the Process**

- **Trial and Error:** Don’t be discouraged if your first attempts don’t go as planned. It’s common to break bits, misalign materials, or get unexpected results. Mistakes are part of the learning process.
- **Material Wastage:** You will likely waste some material during the learning phase, whether from incorrect settings or accidents. Plan for some losses as you refine your skills.

### 5. **Machine Maintenance**

- **Regular Upkeep:** CNC machines require regular maintenance to perform optimally. This includes cleaning the machine, lubricating parts, checking for loose bolts, and inspecting wiring and belts.
- **Replacing Parts:** Over time, you’ll need to replace parts like end mills, which dull with use, or belts and bearings that wear out. Knowing how to maintain your machine will help avoid costly breakdowns.
- **Calibration:** Keeping your machine properly calibrated is key for accuracy. Routine checks on squareness, zeroing, and other factors will save you time and material in the long run.

### 6. **Time Commitment**

- **Setup and Testing:** Expect a significant amount of time to be spent on project setup—securing the workpiece, setting up toolpaths, and making sure everything is aligned. Testing new designs or tool setups on scrap materials is often necessary.
- **Project Completion:** Projects can take longer than expected, especially if you are refining a design, troubleshooting issues, or making multiple passes on a complicated cut. Patience is key.

### 7. **Community Support**

- **Learning from Others:** The CNC woodworking community is large and active. Online forums, YouTube tutorials, and CNC groups are invaluable resources for troubleshooting, tips, and inspiration. You’re not alone in the learning process.
- **Asking for Help:** Don’t hesitate to ask questions when you get stuck. Most CNC enthusiasts are willing to share their knowledge and help you through challenges.

### Final Thought: **Start Small**

- It’s tempting to jump straight into large or complex projects, but starting with simpler tasks will help you build confidence and understand your machine. Set realistic expectations for your first few months, focus on mastering the basics, and steadily work your way up to more advanced projects.

Embarking on your CNC journey can be incredibly rewarding, but it requires patience, learning, and ongoing investment. Stay curious, and embrace the mistakes as learning opportunities.
